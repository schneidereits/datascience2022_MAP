AB  - Nitrate pollution in oxygenated karst aquifers is common due to nitrification and anthropogenic inputs. However, the shift of nitrogen sources influenced by enhanced rural tourism activities and land use changes are not well understood. In this study, hydrochemistry and dual nitrate isotopes of water samples from a rural karst basin in Chongqing, southwestern China were employed to investigate the nitrate fate and its decadal change during the periods from 2007–2008 and 2017–2019. The results showed that δ15N–NO3 and δ18O–NO3 values at the groundwater basin resurgence averaged 9 ± 3.4‰ and 2.5 ± 3.4‰, respectively, with a mean NO3− concentration of 19.7 ± 5.4 mg/L in 2017–2019, clearly exceeding natural background levels. The dual isotope results suggested that nitrification occurred at the sampled sites. From 2007–2008 to 2017–2019, the mean δ15N–NO3 values from the primary sink point and the resurgence of the underground river water samples increased from −0.2 ± 2.1 to 11.2 ± 4.8‰, 4.2 ± 0.9 to 9.0 ± 3.4‰, respectively. A Bayesian mixing model in R (MixSIAR) based on the isotopes revealed that soil organic nitrogen, and manure and sewage proportions for the groundwater increased by 34% and 23%, respectively, while chemical fertilizer and atmospheric precipitation proportions decreased by 32% and 25%, respectively. These decadal changes resulted from reforestation practices and enhanced rural tourism activities in the basin, which were evidenced by the change of land use patterns. The elevated nitrogen load from the rapid development of rural tourism is likely to increase this contamination in the near future if the infrastructure cannot meet the demands. The results from this study could contribute to minimizing environmental health risks in drinking water when rural tourism activities are increasing. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Mixed conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, face threats from frequent high-severity reburns caused by fuel accumulation and increasingly dry, hot conditions associated with climate change. Stand replacing fire and establishment of expansive shrub patches may result in positive feedbacks causing landscapes to convert to persistent shrubland or grassland. Our objective was to examine changes in mixed conifer forest density and species composition after successive fires across a range of initial and reburn severities. We resampled 134 field plots 5–6 years after the Chips Fire reburned stands initially burned by the Storrie and Rich fires on the Lassen and Plumas National Forests. Generalized Linear Models and post-hoc margins analyses were used to examine the interaction effects of initial and reburn fire severities on changes in conifer tree and seedling densities, percent cover of shrubs, and changes in species composition evaluated using fire tolerance index. We found that successive fires with severities less than high-severity significantly reduced tree densities to values within or close to the natural range of variation for mixed conifer stands. Despite these changes in density, species composition did not shift toward increasing dominance of fire tolerant species; mature trees and seedlings of true firs and other fire intolerant species remained dominant after successive low and moderate severity fires. Seedling establishment pulses were associated with sampling years with abundant precipitation, and unburned, unchanged, and low-severity plots in the reburn sample had significant increases in seedling densities across the range of initial burn severities. Shrub cover increased significantly with only a few reburn severity interactions, but declined significantly with repeated high-severity fire. Although two low- to moderate-severity fires may reduce tree densities to within the natural range of variation, they may not shift species composition towards historical patterns. Selective thinning in areas that burned at low- to moderate-severity may be necessary to restore historical species composition in Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forests. © 2022

AB  - The achievement of goals in forest landscape restoration strongly relies on successful plantation establishment, which is challenging in drylands, especially under climate change. Improvement of field performance through stock quality has been used for decades. Here, we use machine learning (ML) techniques to identify key stock traits involved in successful survival and to refine previous specifications that were developed under more conventional stock quality assessments carried out at the lifting–shipping phases in the nursery. Two differentiated stocklots in each species were used, both fitting in the regional quality standard. ML was used to infer a set of attributes for planted seedlings that were subsequently related to survival at the short-term (two years) and mid-term (ten years) in six different species planted in a harsh site with shallow soil that suffered the driest year on record during this study. Whilst stocklot quality, as measured in the lifting–shipping stage, had very poor importance to the survival response, individual plant traits presented a moderate to high diagnostic ability for seedling survival (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve between 0.59 and 0.99). Early growth traits catch most of the importance in these models (≈40%), followed by individual morphology traits (≈28%) and site variation (≈2%), with overall means varying across species. Aleppo pine and Phoenician juniper stocklots presented survival rates of 66–78% after ten years, and these rates were below 27% for the remaining species that suffered during the historical drought. In Aleppo pine, the plant attributes related to early field performance (growth in the first growing season) were more important in the drought-mediated mid-term performance than stock quality at the nursery stage. Within the technical framework of this study, our results allow for both testing and refining the regional quality standard specifications for harsh conditions such as those found in our study. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The relationships between trade-off and synergy in ecosystem services (ESs) is essential for eco-environmental management and restoration in Karst regions, and many researchers have focused heavily on this. However, to date, and to the best of our knowledge, we still lack an adequate understanding of the driving factors of relationship changes and the optimization of the spatial pattern of ESs in this region. In this study, a Bayesian belief network (BBN) model was developed to link three major ESs—net primary productivity (NPP), water yield (WY), and soil conservation (SC)—and determine the driving factors regarding trade-off changes. Furthermore, the multi-scenario scheme of ES optimization was obtained and suggestions are provided in this paper for ecological restoration and decision-making in Guizhou Province, China. The results revealed that the relationships of regional ESs were mainly synergistic, but the synergistic relationship was weakening, accompanied by a trade-off trend during the study period. The area ratios with an enhancement of trade-offs in NPP and SC, SC and WY, and NPP and WY were 17.9%, 28.6%, and 26.6%, respectively, which indicates a significant uncoordinated changes between WY and the two other ESs. The ES relationships in this region are underpinned by multiple factors. Among them, water resources are the primary natural factor that restricts the concerted development of ESs, and the afforestation area (AA) is the main human factor that lowers the trade-offs among ESs. The superiority and distribution scope of ecological restoration were recognized through a multi-scenario analysis of the BBN model. In terms of the superiority of ecological restoration, it was concluded that scenario 3 > scenario 2 > scenario 1; in terms of the restoration area, it was scenario 1 > scenario 2 > scenario 3. Duyun City, in the south of Guizhou Province, as well as surrounding counties, were regions with a high probability of trade-off occurrences, and they could be regions for future ES optimization. Based on the driving factors and the occurrence probability of trade-offs, the ecological restoration area was identified, and it was found the ESs trade-off in this region can be decreased by adjusting a combination of the key variables’ key states. This study provides insight towards achieving a mechanistic understanding and spatial expression of the driving forces underpinning trade-offs/synergies, in turn ensuring the accurate implementation of ecological restoration and the effective management of karst ecosystems. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Study region: The Huangfuchuan Basin on the Loess Plateau, China. Study focus: Runoff and the sediment load of the Yellow River in China have received substantial attention owing to their marked declines over recent decades. Climate change and intensive anthropogenic activities—soil and water conservation measures on the Loess Plateau—are regarded as the main factors responsible for the dramatic declines. Thus, attribution analysis on the roles of such influencing factors is important for the sustainable management. In this study, annual-scale variations of runoff and sediment load of a typical watershed undergoing intensive change were simulated using three regression algorithms. The impacts of climate change, namely precipitation and temperature, and anthropogenic activities, namely channel measures (check dam construction) and slope measures (terracing, afforestation, grass planting, and closures), on runoff and sediment load variations were quantified continuously for the period 1954–2015. New hydrological insights for the region: Results indicated that the main climate change factor was precipitation reduction, which was attributed to 35% and 34% of runoff reduction and sediment load reduction, respectively. Channel measures caused 32% and 39% of runoff reduction and sediment load reduction, respectively, whereas slope measures caused 33% and 27% of runoff reduction and sediment load reduction, respectively. We recommend that further implications of soil and water conservation measures be studied carefully on the Loess Plateau. © 2022

AB  - Counting the trees in a given area or city is meaningful when making decisions for government policies and administration, including the international afforestation effort (i.e., the Trillion Trees Campaign). Determining individual trees on a large scale poses significant challenges, especially in subtropical and tropical areas, because of their diverse crown characteristics. Using very high-spatial-resolution images, we can see the tree crowns clearly. In this study, we counted the population number of trees in the subtropical mega city of Guangzhou, and we used an end-to-end tree-counting deep-learning framework in the regional-scale tree detection by delineating each tree crown. It is a simple framework in which individual trees can be detected directly without manual operation. We used the cascade mask regions with convolutional neural networks (CMask R-CNN) as the backbone and added three types of attention modules to build the derivatives of the CMask R-CNN. The experimental results showed that the CMask R-CNN performed the best among all of the methods, and more than 112 million individual trees with crown sizes of large than 1 m2 were detected. The experimental assessment indicated that the accuracy was 88.32% in terms of the R2 value and 82.56% in terms of the F1-score. This study not only revealed the number of trees, but it also provided the tree density at different scales, which is a prominent component of the ecosystem structure. We also analyzed the tree density at the 30 m and 1000 m scales. The experimental results showed that Guangzhou has a high canopy cover with a tree density of 150 trees per hectare. For the entire city, the tree density is highest in the northern area of Guangzhou, followed by the central part. From the central-western part to the central-eastern part, the tree density increases. The lowest tree density is located in the southern part of Guangzhou near the Pearl River estuary, which is a basic farmland conservation area. It is notable that the tree density of the urban land is about 15 trees per 900 m2, indicating a good living environment. The method developed in this study provides a flexible means of large-scale tree counting without manual operation based on very high-spatial-resolution images. © 2021

AB  - Natural regeneration of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) plays a crucial role in the future of many European mountain forests. It is affected by various soil and stand-related factors whose relative importance, especially in mixed stands, is still not known. In this study, we assessed the importance of stand composition, soil wetness, disturbances and different microsites and seedbeds for regeneration of beech and spruce in a mixed old-growth mountain forest. We also focused on how the effects of these factors change as regeneration gets older. We sampled all regeneration in 563 plots from different microsite types (deadwood, intact soil, treethrow pits and mounds), distinguishing three seedbeds (mosses, beech litter, bare substrate) for seedlings. We used soil survey and tree census data with generalized linear mixed models and variance partitioning to identify the main factors driving tree regeneration and their relative importance. Although beech was slightly less abundant in the canopy than spruce, it strongly outnumbered spruce in regeneration. Beech regeneration showed an affinity for beech litter-rich microsites and drier soils, while spruce was more common on deadwood and moister soils and its response to the seedbed was microsite-specific. The regeneration of both species was positively related to the proportion of their own species in the canopy, but more so in seedlings than in older regeneration cohorts, where soil wetness was more important. The overall pattern of tree regeneration thus resulted from a complex interplay between site conditions and their alterations by current and former generations of canopy trees through the creation of new microsites (deadwood, uprooting mounds) or litter production. Where beech regeneration is not suppressed by excess soil wetness, it is much more successful than spruce due to its shade tolerance and ability to be established in the beech litter that dominates the forest floor. On the other hand, spruce regeneration is mostly restricted to elevated microsites with lower litter accumulation, such as deadwood and treethrow mounds. Our results indicate that both species exhibit an ability to modify their environment in favor of their own regeneration, but under current conditions, beech is more successful than spruce and can be expected to increase its dominance in the future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The rural and tribal communities of Madhya Pradesh's Shivpuri District depend on forest resources for meeting their domestic energy needs, forest products, and employment. Under Green India Mission, households were randomly selected and surveyed. The data of 61 households from 3 villages of Satanwada range (dry deciduous forest) and 131 households from 4 villages in Pichhore range (dry deciduous scrub forest) was collected through semi-structured questionnaire interviews and direct observation. Generalised Linear Model was used to determine the major factors affecting fuelwood collection. The study revealed the factors affecting the amount of fuelwood collection in Satanwada and Pichhore. Family size of households near to the forest negatively affected the amount of fuelwood collected; opportunity cost of fuelwood collection was lower for them than for families living further away from the forest in Satanwada. In Pichhore, LPG consumption reduced the amount of fuelwood collected, while cow dung complimented the quantity of fuelwood collected. Since the availability of fuelwood was scarce, alternate energy resources became determining factors of the amount of fuelwood collected. In both ranges, the distance of the forest from households had a positive effect on the quantity of fuelwood consumed due to higher opportunity cost and degradation of adjacent forests. The study also revealed a strong correlation between the sampled population percentage of women in villages and the sampled village cattle count. The study also showed the difference of fuelwood collection in Satanwada (8.8 0.6 kg) and Pichhore (6.8 0.4 kg) suggesting that forest degradation correlates with lesser utilisation of forest resources. Hence, the study justifies the need of synergy between public rural provisions of alternative fuel sources with afforestation programs. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The quantification of reforestation on abandoned land is of high importance due to various environmental and socio-economic consequences. This article aims to determine the role of different factors in the reforestation of abandoned plots in particular mid-forest glades in the higher parts of the Western Carpathians and to detect the feature of plots covered prevalently with forest. The Reforestation Index (RI) was used to detect changes in reforestation. Bayesian multilevel zero-one inflated beta regression was used to determine the predictors of reforestation. Using the series of consecutive aerial photographs enabled the differences between features of plots with a faster rate of reforestation and plots covered entirely with forest to be shown. The most rapid changes in the RI were observed in plots with the lowest level of solar radiation (north exposure). In contrast, the highest RI concerns plots with south exposure, the highest mean slope, and within plots partly forested in the first year of observation. Such an attitude is crucial for areas where the precise date of land abandonment is unknown because it enables a determination of which type of plot was abandoned first. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The Aral Sea, once the fourth largest freshwater lake on Earth, has lost circa 90% of its original water surface in 1960. Maps of different land cover categories provide a suitable baseline to plan and implement effective measures to combat ongoing desertification, such as reforestation of dried out Aral Sea soils. In this study, we used satellite-based remote sensing data and applied a machine learning method (Random Forest) to map land cover in the Aralkum in 2020. We tested different satellite data from optical (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2) and Radar instruments (Sentinel-1) and trained a random forest model for classifying different combinations of these data sets into ten distinct land cover classes. We further calculated per-pixel uncertainty based on posterior classification probability scores. An accuracy assessment, based on in-situ data, revealed that the average overall accuracy of land cover maps was 86.8%. Fusing optical and radar instruments achieved the highest overall accuracy (88.8%, with lower/higher 95% confidence interval values of 87.6%/89.9%, and a Kappa value of 0.865. Classification uncertainty was lower in more homogeneous landscapes (i.e. large expanses of a single land cover class like water or shrubland). Only around 9% of the study area was still water in 2020, while 32% was covered by saline soils with high erosion risk. Several potential applications of this land cover map in the Aralkum exist–spanning many areas of environmental impact assessment, policy, and planning and management or afforestation. This methodological framework can similarly provide a useful template for more broadly assessing large-scale, land dynamics at high-resolution in the entire Aralkum and surrounding areas. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning are important tools at the forefront of automated forest monitoring research, where classification of individual tree species is a critical forest management goal. Near-infrared (NIR) information provided by specialized UAV sensors may improve classification accuracy at the cost of added operational complexity; however, this potential for improvement is context-dependent and, therefore, may not be necessary. We assessed the performance of conventional red-green-blue (RGB) versus NIR imagery when classifying regenerating lodgepole pine and white spruce crowns automatically delineated by a trained deep learning algorithm. Models trained on NIR imagery slightly outperformed those trained on RGB imagery. Models trained on spectral bands outperformed those trained on spectral indices. The minor difference in performance between the two sets of imagery showed that accurate classification of lodgepole pine and white spruce can be carried-out using conventional RGB imagery. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - It has been debated if Chilean sclerophyllous vegetation can recover after fire of different severity and short and long term. We evaluated the resiliency of this vegetation type after single-occurrence fires of different severities that occurred 30, 20 and 10 years in Central Chile before the study. Two approaches were followed: satellite image analysis and vegetation sampling. Wildfires that occurred between 1985 and 2015 were identified based on Landsat images. We selected 30 sites burned by a single fire in either 1985, 1995 or 2005, and that was not converted to another land use by 2015, then determined the percentage cover by vegetation type. We recorded or estimated the independent variables of burn severity, slope, altitude, pre-fire vegetation type and latitude of the sites. Composition, richness, and abundance of adult and regeneration of woody vegetation and herbaceous cover were sampled. Generalized linear models were used to evaluate the effect of the independent variables and the time elapsed since the fire on vegetation recovery. The proportion of dense vegetation forest cover was significantly higher with more time elapsed since the fire, while semi-dense forest/shrubland and open shrubland vegetation cover returned to pre-fire levels more quickly. The richness and abundance of regenerated woody species was significantly greater with more time elapsed since the fire. However, no relationship was found between species richness and abundance of adult woody species and time elapsed post-fire. We found that vegetative recovery over time was not related to burn severity. Forested and mixed forest/shrubland cover is reached 10–20 years after the fire, if no further intervention occurs. Richness and species abundance was similar to that of unburned sites after 20 or more years post-fire. This study provided evidence that forest vegetation in the Chilean Mediterranean ecosystem is resilient to fires of at least low and medium intensities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forest and land fires in Indonesia are one of the most common disasters. Over time, Indonesia's forests have experienced a decline, one of which is the result of forest and land fires. Forest and land fires can occur due to temperatures in the dry season that continue to increase. Utilization of remote sensing technology can be used for mapping forest and fire areas, and can also be used as a reference for the government to carry out reforestation or reforestation processes in fire areas. The use of Multispectral Sensors in Sentinel 2 satellite imagery can be used to produce this research. This research takes a case study on Mount Lawu, Magetan Regency. Mount Lawu is one of the climbing tourist destinations that almost every year experiences forest and land fires. And the use of the Google Earth Engine platform that supports cloud computing to facilitate this research in accessing high data sources to process large geospatial data sets. For processing satellite images using the Normalized Burned Ratio (NBR) vegetation index processing algorithm. This research was conducted in 2018 and 2019. By using the Random Forest method, which is one of the applications of Machine Learning, it will produce several accurate results from the calculation results. The results of the calculation of the area of fire in 2018 were 284.88 hectares with a total loss of Rp 42,732,000.00 and in 2019 it was 146.03 hectares with a total loss of Rp 21,904,500.

AB  - Forests are often affected by management that could influence demographics of breeding and post-breeding birds that reside within. Numerous studies have focused on immediate effects from management on wildlife soon after forestry treatment (e.g., 0–5 years); however, fewer studies have examined changes in focal species abundance over longer durations as a forest regenerates after disturbance. We examined how forest management influenced 18 conifer-associated birds during breeding and post-breeding over the forest regeneration period in a landscape dominated by forestry. To achieve this, we combined avian detection data from point count surveys conducted in lowland conifer and mixed-wood forests in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont with Bayesian distance-removal models and an information-theoretic framework. We estimated abundance and associations with seven common forestry treatment categories applied at the stand scale, years-since-harvest (YSH; 5–120 + ), and seven vegetation variables measured within stands. Forestry treatment categories and YSH were poor predictors of abundance. Of 14 species with models having good-fitting statistical distributions while including forestry treatments and YSH as covariates, no species had associations. Of 13 species with models having good-fitting statistical distributions while including vegetation covariates, 12 had important associations between abundance and vegetation variables. Each vegetation variable was associated with abundance of some species, irrespective of the forestry treatment in which the site occurred, including spruce-fir tree composition (seven species), tree basal area (six species), midstory cover (five species), live crown ratio (three species), shrub cover (three species), tree diameter at breast height (two species), and shrub composition (one species). In a companion study, several species assemblages were associated with vegetation variables (i.e., spruce-fir tree composition, tree basal area, and tree diameter at breast height) that were associated with YSH and forestry treatments, suggesting that some forestry treatments may indirectly influence avian abundance when certain vegetation outcomes are achieved. Our results suggest that managers could target species-specific vegetation outcomes rather than more broadly categorized forestry treatment types when managing for individual focal species because of large variations in vegetative outcomes across stands within a forest treatment category. Our study informs management and conservation of biodiversity in regions such as the Atlantic Northern Forest in North America where commercial forestry is the dominant human land use. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Quantifying the drivers of terrestrial vegetation dynamics is critical for monitoring ecosystem carbon sequestration and bioenergy production. Large scale vegetation dynamics can be observed using the leaf area index (LAI) derived from satellite data as a measure of 'greenness'. Previous studies have quantified the effects of climate change and carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization on vegetation greenness. In contrast, the specific roles of land-use-related drivers (LURDs) on vegetation greenness have not been characterized. Here, we combined the Interior-Point Method-optimized ecosystem model and the Bayesian model averaging statistical method to disentangle the roles of LURDs on vegetation greenness in China from 2000 to 2014. Results showed a significant increase in growing season LAI (greening) over 35% of the land area of China, whereas less than 6% of it exhibited a significantly decreasing trend (browning). The overall impact of LURDs on vegetation greenness over the whole country was comparatively low. However, the local effects of LURDs on the greenness trends of some specified areas were considerable due to afforestation and urbanization. Southern Coastal China had the greatest area fractions (35.82% of its corresponding area) of the LURDs effects on greening, following by Southwest China. It was because of these economic regions with great afforestation programs. Afforestation effects could explain 27% of the observed greening trends in the forest area. In contrast, the browning impact caused by urbanization was approximately three times of the greening effects of both climate change and CO2 fertilization on the urban area. And they made the urban area had a 50% decrease in LAI. The effects of residual LURDs only accounted for less than 8% of the corresponding observed greenness changes. Such divergent roles would be valuable for understanding changes in local ecosystem functions and services under global environmental changes. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Earthquakes are one of the worst natural disasters, causing environmental fluctuations and ecosystem degradation. Previous studies have evaluated the macro-characteristics of vegetation recovery after earthquakes. However, the internal mechanisms driving community assembly and diversity remain poorly understood. This study was located in Longxi-Hongkou National Natural Reserve, China. We investigated the current vegetation status of typical large-scale landslides in regions with the highest intensity of earthquake damage in the area affected by the 2008 magnitude 8.0 earthquake, and studied the community assembly using phylogenetic methods. Relationships between community assembly and influencing factors were carried out using generalized linear models (GLMs) and redundancy analysis (RDA). Our findings suggested that the communities in areas of larger landslides were dominated by herbs 11 years after the earthquake and had not yet regenerated to the original community. The average net relatedness index (NRI) and nearest taxon index (NTI) of the communities were 0.293 and 0.482, respectively, which were higher than those of the null model. These results showed a clustered phylogenetic pattern and suggested that the community assembly process in the early regeneration stage after the earthquake supported the environmental filtering hypothesis. Altitude negatively impacted species diversity, NRI, NTI and phylogenetic diversity. This result suggested that the community assembly process was more dependent on abiotic regulation than biotic regulation at high altitudes after earthquakes. Species diversity, NRI, NTI and phylogenetic diversity were also impacted by landslide intensity; however, the responses to landslide intensity were not completely equivalent for landslides of varying widths and lengths. Slope aspect impacted the phylogenetic diversity of the regenerating community after the earthquake; that is, the sunny slopes had higher phylogenetic diversity than the shady slopes. Soil type, soil organic carbon, soil nitrogen, soil moisture, and soil phosphorous impacted community assembly. Collectively, This work showed evidence supporting the abiotic regulation of community assembly after earthquakes and reported the key abiotic influencing factors. It is important for a general understanding of community assembly after strong disturbances in temperate forests and beyond and can also provide a theoretical basis for ecological restoration engineering design. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fire and drought are two major agents that shape Mediterranean ecosystems, but their interacting effects on forest resilience have not been yet fully addressed. We used Pinus halepensis to investigate how compound fire-drought regimes determine the success of post-fire regeneration. We measured the density of P.halepensis newly established individuals following fire in forty-three sites along the Spanish east coast, the wetter region of the species distribution. The climatic niche of P.halepensis was characterized by considering their populations across its Spanish distribution range. We used yearly values (1979–2013 period) of accumulated precipitation, mean temperature and the warmest quarter values of these two variables to generate the climatic space or climatic niche occupied by the species. Kernel density estimates were then applied to determine the niche centroid, which would correspond to the species’ climatic optimum within its Spanish distribution range. Then, we computed the pre- and post-fire climatic deviations of each sampling site as the difference between site-specific climate conditions respect to the species niche centroid, and assessed their relationship with the success of post-fire regeneration. We found highly variable patterns of post-fire regeneration density of P.halepensis over the studied sites, ranging from 7 to 42,822 tree pines ha−1. Generalized linear models indicated a positive relationship between fire severity and the density of P.halepensis regeneration. Positive temperature deviations - warm conditions - before fire were positively related to pine regeneration. This effect increases under higher fire severity. By contrast, warm temperatures after fire showed a negative effect on the density of pine trees. Positive precipitation deviations - wet conditions - after fire enhanced pine regeneration, while precipitation before fire did not had any significant effect. Though P.halepensis is considered a species adapted to fire and drought, the interaction between these two disturbances can alter the success of its post-fire recovery patterns limiting the species’ resilience in the future. © 2021

AB  - Tropical forests are experiencing reduced productivity and will need restoration with suitable species. Knowledge of species-specific responses to changing environments during early stage can help identify the appropriate species for sustainable planting. Hence, we investigated the variability in whole-tree canopy conductance and transpiration (Gt and EL) in potted saplings of common urban species in Thailand, viz., Pterocarpus indicus, Lagerstroemia speciosa, and Swietenia macrophylla, across wet and dry seasons in 2017–2018. Using a Bayesian modeling framework, Gt and EL were estimated from sap flux density, informed by the soil, atmospheric and tree measurements. Subsequently, we evaluated their variations with changing vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and soil moisture across timescales and season. We found that Gt and EL were higher and highly variable in L. speciosa across seasons than S. macrophylla and P. indicus. Our results implied that water-use in these species was sensitive to seasonal VPD. L. speciosa may be suitable under future climate variability, given its higher Gt and EL across atmospheric and soil moisture conditions. With their lower Gt and EL, P. indicus and S. macrophylla may photosynthesize throughout the year, maintaining their stomatal opening even under high VPD. These findings benefit reforestation and reclamation programs of degraded lands. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Choosing Selecting suitable sites for afforestation is a complex process that is influenced by various factors that require the use of new models and methods in order to create better results. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the use of a machine learning framework to map the best sites for afforestation with J. excelsa, an important species for soil and water conservation in Firuzkuh County, Tehran Province, Iran. Existing stands of J. excelsa were located. Measures of 14 environmental variables were compiled at each site. Three machine learning algorithms–Fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM), Multi-layers perceptron (MLP), and Classification tree analysis (CTA) – were used to model ideal locations for growing the tree. They were compared in terms of success rate. The best performance was achieved by CTA (area under curve (AUC) = 0.899). MLP (AUC = 0.892) was second best, and FAM (AUC = 0.835) had the lowest success. All three models achieved very good to excellent results; however, the CTA model was the most effective. Locations of high and very high favorability for J. excelsa comprise between 8% and 18% of the study area. The factors that are most important for the locations of replanting are those with bedrock of the Cl geological group and where rainfall ranges from 350 mm/year and 450 mm/year. This study offers support to decision makers for improving (lower cost and less time) selection of planting sites that are more likely to support tree survival to achieve natural restoration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - China has increased its vegetation coverage and enhanced its terrestrial carbon sink through ecological restoration since the end of the 20th century. However, the temporal variation in vegetation carbon sequestration remains unclear, and the relative effects of climate change and ecological restoration efforts are under debate. By integrating remote sensing and machine learning with a modelling approach, we explored the biological and physical pathways by which both climate change and human activities (e.g., ecological restoration, cropland expansion, and urbanization) have altered Chinese terrestrial ecosystem structures and functions, including vegetation cover, surface heat fluxes, water flux, and vegetation carbon sequestration (defined by gross and net primary production, GPP and NPP). Our study indicated that during 2001–2018, GPP in China increased significantly at a rate of 49.1–53.1 TgC/yr2, and the climatic and anthropogenic contributions to GPP gains were comparable (48%–56% and 44%–52%, respectively). Spatially, afforestation was the dominant mechanism behind forest cover expansions in the farming-pastoral ecotone in northern China, on the Loess Plateau and in the southwest karst region, whereas climate change promoted vegetation cover in most parts of southeastern China. At the same time, the increasing trend in NPP (22.4–24.9 TgC/yr2) during 2001–2018 was highly attributed to human activities (71%–81%), particularly in southern, eastern, and northeastern China. Both GPP and NPP showed accelerated increases after 2010 because the anthropogenic NPP gains during 2001–2010 were generally offset by the climate-induced NPP losses in southern China. However, after 2010, the climatic influence reversed, thus highlighting the vegetation carbon sequestration that occurs with ecological restoration. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Originating in conservation biology, systematic conservation biology (SCP) is a practical approach that aims to provide decision support for planning conservation actions by integrating ecological objectives with socio-economic management constraints. Based on modelling, optimization and computer technology, SCP provides an evidence-based framework to address environmental issues and narrow the gap between research and implementation. In this PhD thesis, we introduced a formal approach to modelling and resolving SCP problems based on constraint programming, a method derived from artificial intelligence and based on automated reasoning. The main reason for adopting this approach was to increase the expressiveness of SCP (i.e. extend the breadth and variety of problems that users can represent and resolve), in particular by integrating advanced spatial constraints and landscape indices. This approach also provides guarantees as to the satisfiability and optimality of the solutions produced. Such guarantees can substantially improve the quality of decision support. We assessed the methods developed during this thesis against real data from New Caledonian forests. As one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots, New Caledonia has to struggle with many conservation challenges. Moreover, the New Caledonian island context, being at once developed and thinly populated, brings conservation stakeholders into close proximity, which makes it an appropriate field of study to experiment with novel approaches. We illustrated this particularity through a real case study, conducted in close collaboration with the managers of the “Côte Oubliée - Woen Vùù - Pwa Pereeù" provincial park. In this study, we aimed to provide decision support for a reforestation project, with an emphasis on reducing fragmentation and improving structural connectivity. Overall, we demonstrated the generic, flexible and expressive nature of the constraint-based SCP approach. Our results also opened up new perspectives for decision support in New Caledonia, for systematic conservation planning and for constraint programming. © 2021, Bois et Forêts des Tropiques.

AB  - Evaluation of forest sites capability (EFSC) is important for the restoration of degraded areas. The current costly EFSC approaches developed based on forest stand structure criteria is too costly for less developed countries (LDC) and not suitable for severely degraded lands. This paper describes an inexpensive Landscape-fuzzy approach for forest capability evaluation (LFAFCE) that can be used to restore degraded forest areas especially in LDC. Five physical criteria of slope, hillshade, altitude, precipitation, and geo formation were evaluated in the Zagros region of western Iran using the fuzzy membership functions, prioritized by analytic network process (ANP), and combined with GIS-based weighted linear combination. We then performed multi-criteria evaluation integrated by GIS. Given the positive correlation between the independent variable of EFSC and the dependent variable of the dominant tree height, the model results were validated based on the linear regression of the relationship between the two variables. The results of the validation showed that the linear regression model with appropriate coefficient of determination was significant. The results of EFSC by LFAFCE showed that most of the forest area was allocated to two classes: well (75%) and moderate (21.8%). In total, only 3.2% of the area belonged to the marginal (0.4%), high (0.1%), and unsuitable regions (2.7%) classes. Our results demonstrate that LFAFCE is valid for low-cost evaluation of degraded area in Zagros and for other similar areas, if calibrated, where normal forest mass parameters are not available. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - An accurate estimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is important for carbon accounting and afforestation policy making, and the aspect factors that affect forest stand growth are important to the accuracy of AGB estimation. In this study, aspect was incorporated as a variable into three machine learning algorithms (MLAs) (support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF)), to estimate the AGB of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) planted forests in 96 field plots with four different aspects (sunny slope, semi-sunny slope, semi-shady slope and shady slope). The results showed that in the models incorporating aspect variables, the increase in accuracy varied from 36.72% to 41.23% for 29 validation plots based on R2. The A-RF model (RF with aspect variable), which had the highest R2 (0.8519) and lowest RMSE and rRMSE (12.552 Mg/ha and 0.175) was considered optimal for AGB estimation of black locust planted forests. The overestimation of sunny and shady slopes, and the underestimation of semi-sunny and semi-shady slopes are reduced by incorporating the aspect variable. Areas with lower AGB values mainly occur on sunny and shady slopes, and areas with higher AGB values mainly occur on semi-sunny and semi-shady slopes. Overall, our study demonstrates that the introduction of the aspect variable provided the model with a basis for the effects of different growth conditions of black locust planted forests on different aspects, which can improve the accuracy of AGB estimation. © 2021

AB  - In recent years, with the aggravation of climate change and human activities, the global forest area continues to reduce, forest quality keeps declining, and the ecological and environmental events occur frequently. Thus, forest health issues have received unprecedented attention, and have become an important part of the ecological civilization strategy. China's forest resources continue to grow, but it also faces some problems, such as single afforestation structure, low stand quality and weak ecological stability. How to evaluate forest health systematically and accurately is still a difficult problem. Compared with the traditional ground survey methods, remote sensing technology has the advantages of macroscopic, timeliness and economic efficiency. With the rapid development of high-resolution remote sensing and artificial intelligence technology, it is possible to overcome the problem of forest health assessment. In order to systematically evaluate the potential of new remote sensing technology, this paper points out the existing paths and methods on the basis of literature analysis, including: (1) through bibliometric analysis, four core contents of forest health assessment (vitality, organizational structure, resistance and resilience) and four key issues (tree species classification, forest vitality, forest pests, drought threat) were identified. (2) Systematically interpreting the advantages and disadvantages of existing remote sensing technologies from three angles, namely, different scales (single tree stand ecosystem landscape), different platforms (near ground remote sensing, aerial remote sensing satellite remote sensing) and different sensors (including RGB cameras, multi/hyperspectral cameras, lidar, thermal infrared cameras, microwave radars and chlorophyll fluorescence scanners). (3) Focusing on four key issues, this paper expounds the application path and method of remote sensing technology to evaluate forest health in recent years. Furthermore, this paper points out the challenges and opportunities, including multi-source fusion analysis, forest health monitoring network and near ground remote sensing, forest health big data application, in order to provide reference for the intelligent management of forest resources in China. © 2021, Editorial Department of Journal of Beijing Forestry University.

AB  - Documenting the impacts of climate change and human activities on tropical rainforests is imperative for protecting tropical biodiversity and for better implementation of REDD+ and UN Sustainable Development Goals. Recent advances in very high-resolution satellite sensor systems (i.e., WorldView-3), computing power, and machine learning (ML) have provided improved mapping of fine-scale changes in the tropics. However, approaches so far focused on feature extraction or the extensive tuning of ML parameters, hindering the potential of ML in forest conservation mapping by not using textural information, which is found to be powerful for many applications. Additionally, the contribution of shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands in forest cover mapping is unknown. The objectives were to develop end-to-end mapping of the tropical forest using fully convolution neural networks (FCNNs) with WorldView-3 (WV-3) imagery and to evaluate human impact on the environment using the Betampona Nature Reserve (BNR) in Madagascar as the test site. FCNN (U-Net) using spatial/textural information was implemented and compared with feature-fed pixel-based methods including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). Results show that the FCNN model outperformed other models with an accuracy of 90.9%, while SVM, RF, and DNN provided accuracies of 88.6%, 84.8%, and 86.6%, respectively. When SWIR bands were excluded from the input data, FCNN provided superior performance over other methods with a 1.87% decrease in accuracy, while the accuracies of other models—SVM, RF, and DNN—decreased by 5.42%, 3.18%, and 8.55%, respectively. Spatial–temporal analysis showed a 0.7% increase in Evergreen Forest within the BNR and a 32% increase in tree cover within residential areas likely due to forest regeneration and conservation efforts. Other effects of conservation efforts are also discussed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Butterflies are considered important indicators representing the state of biodiversity and key ecosystem functions, but their use as bioindicators requires a better understanding of how their observed response is linked to environmental factors. Moreover, better understanding how butterfly faunas vary with climate and land cover may be useful to estimate the potential impacts of various drivers, including climate change, botanical succession, grazing, and afforestation. It is particularly important to establish which species of butterflies are sensitive to each environmental driver. The study took place in Israel, including the West Bank and Golan Heights. To develop a robust and systematic approach for identifying how butterfly faunas vary with the environment, we analyzed the occurrence of 73 species and the abundance of 24 species from Israeli Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS-IL) data. We used regional generalized additive models to quantify butterfly abundance, and generalized linear latent variable models and generalized linear models to quantify the impact of temperature, rainfall, soil type, and habitat on individual species and on the species community. Species richness was higher for cooler transects, and also for hilly and mountainous transects in the Mediterranean region (rendzina and Terra rossa soils) compared with the coastal plain (Hamra soil) and semiarid northern Jordan Vale (loessial sierozem soil). Species occurrence was better explained by temperature (negative correlation) than precipitation, while for abundance the opposite pattern was found. Soil type and habitat were insignificant drivers of occurrence and abundance. Butterfly faunas responded very strongly to temperature, even when accounting for other environmental factors. We expect that some butterfly species will disappear from marginal sites with global warming, and a large proportion will become rarer as the region becomes increasingly arid. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Forest restoration is currently a primary objective in environmental management policies at a global scale, to the extent that impressive initiatives and commitments have been launched to plant billions of trees. However, resources are limited and the success of any restoration effort should be maximized. Thus, restoration programs should seek to guarantee that what is planted today will become an adult tree in the future, a simple fact that, however, usually receives little attention. Here, we advocate for the need to focus restoration efforts on an individual plant level to increase establishment success while reducing negative side effects by using an approach that we term “precision forest restoration” (PFR). The objective of PFR will be to ensure that planted seedlings or sowed seeds will become adult trees with the appropriate landscape configuration to create functional and self-regulating forest ecosystems while reducing the negative impacts of traditional massive reforestation actions. PFR can take advantage of ecological knowledge together with technologies and methodologies from the landscape scale to the individual-plant scale, and from the more traditional, low-tech approaches to the latest high-tech ones. PFR may be more expensive at the level of individual plants, but will be more cost-effective in the long term if it allows for the creation of resilient forests able to provide multiple ecosystem services. PFR was not feasible a few years ago due to the high cost and low precision of the available technologies, but it is currently an alternative that might reformulate a wide spectrum of ecosystem restoration activities. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Understory vegetation plays an important role in maintaining biodiversity, soil nutrient cycling and carbon stocks, yet the ability of understory functional traits to predict forest productivity after harvesting disturbance is unknown. Our objective was to investigate the utility of individual traits (the community-weighted trait mean) and combined information from multiple traits (functional diversity indices) of understory plants in predicting tree diameter growth of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) after two harvesting methods (clearcutting and careful logging). We used vegetation and tree growth data from a network of field plots (171 plots on 43 sites) established in black spruce dominated forests across Ontario and Quebec, in northeastern Canada. Functional traits (11 traits) of dominant understory species that reflect plant morphology, regeneration strategy, and resource utilization were collected. We then used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to model the response of tree diameter increment to functional diversity indices, community-weighted trait means and their interactions with harvesting method. Our results showed that: 1) at the functional diversity level, functional richness had a positive relationship with tree growth in clear-cut forests, while functional evenness showed a negative and functional divergence a positive relationship with tree growth in careful logging forests; 2) at the individual trait level, understory species with relatively large morphological trait values often promoted tree growth in both forest types, with stronger relationships in careful logging than in clear-cut forests. For regeneration traits, heavier seed weight or permanent seed bank persistence of understory plants had negative relationships with tree growth, and those relationships were either only found in careful logging forests or did not depend on harvesting type. A positive relationship was found between vegetative propagation species and tree growth, which was stronger in careful logging than in clear-cut forests. Species preferring either humid or xeric habitat had positive relationships with tree growth; both shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant species also positively correlated to tree growth. In conclusion, our study shows the important roles of understory traits in predicting tree growth based on both niche complementarity and mass-ratio hypotheses. Moreover, disturbance severity influenced the balance or degree of the positive and negative interactions that occurred between understory plants and black spruce tree growth. We suggest that identifying the threshold of harvesting disturbance severity that can activate facilitation interactions between understory plants and crop trees would be an important topic for future study. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article presents a computer-aided design framework for the generation of non-standard structural forms in static equilibrium that takes advantage of the interaction between human and machine intelligence. The design framework relies on the implementation of a series of operations (generation, clustering, evaluation, selection, and regeneration) that allow to create multiple design options and to navigate in the design space according to objective and subjective criteria defined by the human designer. Through the interaction between human and machine intelligence, the machine can learn the nonlinear correlation between the design inputs and the design outputs preferred by the human designer and generate new options by itself. In addition, the machine can provide insights into the structural performance of the generated structural forms. Within the proposed framework, three main algorithms are used: Combinatorial Equilibrium Modeling for generating of structural forms in static equilibrium as design options, Self-Organizing Map for clustering the generated design options, and Gradient-Boosted Trees for classifying the design options. These algorithms are combined with the ability of human designers to evaluate non-quantifiable aspects of the design. To test the proposed framework in a real-world design scenario, the design of a stadium roof is presented as a case study. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The forest understory is often densely covered by dwarf bamboo Sasa spp. in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Dwarf bamboo is an important winter forage for sika deer Cervus nippon, and dwarf bamboo inhibits forest regeneration by preventing seedling establishment. Although percentages of browsed seedlings are a useful index of deer browsing pressure, dwarf bamboo is also expected to affect browsing on seedlings by altering physical accessibility to seedlings. We hypothesized that the relationship between seedling height and browsing incidence depends on the coverage of dwarf bamboo because smaller seedlings were protected by dwarf bamboo. The incidence of browsing was recorded for broad-leaved seedlings ≥ 0.2 m in height and &lt; 1 cm in diameter at breast height in 19 plots (40–200 m2 each) located in natural forests. Coverage of dwarf bamboo varied from 3% to 74%, except for one plot where dwarf bamboo was absent. The mean height of the dwarf bamboo in each plot was 0.44–1.17 m. The product of seedling height and coverage of dwarf bamboo was selected as an explanatory variable in the generalized linear mixed model for the incidence of browsing on each seedling. This suggests that smaller seedlings were protected by dwarf bamboo and browsing incidence is low for smaller seedlings within plots with high coverage of dwarf bamboo. This can be an example of associational defense against deer. The probability of browsing incidence was low for seedlings 0.2–0.5 m tall in sites with dense dwarf bamboo, while no significant differences were detected between seedlings 0.5–0.8 m tall and those ≥ 0.8 m. Even though seedlings under dwarf bamboo cover tend to escape from deer browsing, dwarf bamboo directly affects seedling survival and growth negatively. Therefore, it is necessary to manage both the deer population and dwarf bamboo to enable forest regeneration. The percentages of seedlings with browsing incidence on seedlings ≥ 0.5 m tall can approximate the browsing level and is useful for management decisions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In view of the minimum storage regeneration (MSR) single fault node repair plan, design a kind of new single repair fault node topology. Consider link bandwidth available and the node processing power of heterogeneity, the repair delay and repair traffic node of combinatorial optimization. Topology can be converted to Steiner tree model with constraints, and design the corresponding hybrid genetic algorithm to solve the approximate global optimal solution. Finally, a compromise between the two optimization objectives is achieved. Simulation results show that under the same MSR code size, the repair delay of this topology is only 60%-80% of that of the traditional tree topology and 30%-40% of that of the traditional star topology. While the repair traffic for this topology is 9% to 65% higher than for the traditional star topology, the repair traffic is only 40% to 55% higher than for the traditional tree topology. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The role of forests to sequester carbon is considered an important strategy for mitigating climate change and achieving net zero emissions. However, forests in North Korea have continued to be cleared since the 1990s due to the lack of food and energy resources. Deforestation in this country has not been accurately classified nor consistently reported because of the characteristics of small patches. This study precisely determined the area of deforested land in North Korea through the vegetation phenological classification using high-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning algorithms. Effective afforestation target sites in North Korea were identified with priority grade. The U-Net deep learning algorithm and time-series Sentinel-2 satellite images were applied to phenological classification; the results reflected the small patch-like characteristics of deforestation in North Korea. Based on the phenological classification, the land cover of the country was classified with an accuracy of 84.6%; this included 2.6 million ha of unstocked forest and reclaimed forest. Sites for afforestation were prioritized into five grades based on deforested characteristics, altitude and slope. Forest area is expanded and the forest ecosystem is restored through successful afforestation, this may improve the overall ecosystem services in North Korea. In the long term, it will be possible to contribute to carbon neutrality and greenhouse gas reduction on the Korean Peninsula level through optimal afforestation by using these outcomes. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In Côte d'Ivoire, more than 80% of the original forest cover has disappeared due to slash-and-burn shifting agricultural practices, uncontrolled logging, and large-scale land conversion for cash crop cultivation. Yet the demand for timber continues to grow and cannot be met by the scarcity of tree plantations. Despite the widespread presence of secondary forests of various ages in Ivorian landscapes, little is known about recovery trajectories of timber resources and the environmental factors that influence recovery rates. We set up 96 0.2 ha forest plots, along a chronosequence of 1 to 40 years and including 7 controls, on which all commercial trees larger than 2.5 cm in diameter at breast height were inventoried. We modelled the recovery trajectories of four complementary indicators of timber resources (basal area, tree density, size of big trees, bole volume) in a Bayesian framework. Our results show that the four indicators recover at different rates, with tree density recovering in less than 15 years while bole volumes need more than a hundred years to recover. Among the local, landscape, and historical factors studied, the number of remnants and proximity to old-growth forests have a positive impact on recovery rates, with, under good environmental conditions, the density, basal area and size of big trees being almost completely recovered in less than 25 years. Our results demonstrate the very high resilience of the timber resource, but also suggest that the landscape management of these post-forest areas must be differentiated according to the landscape context and the presence of isolated trees, which are the last vestiges of the former forest. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Precise assessments of forest species’ composition help analyze biodiversity patterns, estimate wood stocks, and improve carbon stock estimates. Therefore, the objective of this work was to evaluate the use of high-resolution images obtained from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for the identification of forest species in areas of forest regeneration in the Amazon. For this purpose, convolutional neural networks (CNN) were trained using the Keras–Tensorflow package with the faster_rcnn_inception_v2_pets model. Samples of six forest species were used to train CNN. From these, attempts were made with the number of thresholds, which is the cutoff value of the function; any value below this output is considered 0, and values above are treated as an output 1; that is, values above the value stipulated in the Threshold are considered as identified species. The results showed that the reduction in the threshold decreases the accuracy of identification, as well as the overlap of the polygons of species identification. However, in comparison with the data collected in the field, it was observed that there exists a high correlation between the trees identified by the CNN and those observed in the plots. The statistical metrics used to validate the classification results showed that CNN are able to identify species with accuracy above 90%. Based on our results, which demonstrate good accuracy and precision in the identification of species, we conclude that convolutional neural networks are an effective tool in classifying objects from UAV images. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Land use changes in the Alps over the last few decades have been characterised by a significant increase in forest coverage as a result of the abandonment of marginal agricultural sites. Natural afforestation and species protection laws affected the ecosystem, and therefore the services provided by the mountain environment, including landscape structure and aesthetics, changed. This work assess the changes in the ecosystem services offered by forests since 1954 in a region of the Italian Alps. Some ES were estimated in this work with GIS, and others were taken from the literature or the authors’ previous works. Since the 1950s, forest ecosystem services such as growing stock, protection from hydro-geological hazards and carbon storage have increased. Deer and other forest species have risen in number. On the other hand, there has been a depletion of open space for priority habitats and species such as black grouse and capercaillie. Old postcards were used to understand land use change and people’s aesthetic preferences. To determine people’s preferences for the landscape, we used records of over 300,000 postcards, sold during nearly two decades. The most often chosen postcard portrayed a landscape of the 1970s with a mix of forest and open space, different from the scenario that the buyers could observe. The sales records for over 20 years of postcard business and the dates of the postcards that we obtained in this research allowed us to perform a quantitative analysis of landscape preferences. The main subject of the photo was a good predictor of the number of postcards sold, according to generalised linear models (GLM); and postcards of overly exploited landscapes, dense forest coverage or buildings were significantly less likely to be chosen. Artificially reinstating open areas will boost biodiversity and could recreate a landscape that resembles the historical agro-ecosystem without interfering with the forest’s other functions. These findings will help managers and policy makers evaluate cultural ecosystem resources in the face of changing mountain landscapes. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Understanding forest regeneration in relation to land-use legacies is an important goal of research on global environmental changes and future ecosystem patterns. Recent findings on spruce regeneration on abandoned agricultural land showed it to be linked to land-use legacies involving increased soil fertility by fertilization. We argue that indirect drivers like land-use changes from arable land to grassland, which affect soil fertility and vegetation density, could also be involved. We selected a study area where changes in land-use involved gradual abandonment of agricultural intervention and created substantial heterogeneity in forest stand age and species composition. Over a 60-year period, the tree colonization pattern changed from deciduous tree species in 1950–1970 to Norway spruce in the later period. Generalized linear logistic regression models were generated to explain the presence of deciduous tree and spruce colonization in relation to soil and land-use factors. The importance of plant community composition on establishment of tree species was studied by Cluster analysis and unconstrained ordination. Deciduous forest development was negatively related to past agricultural use as arable land and positively related to extensively used grasslands (meadows and pastures) and no soil factors entered the explanatory model. Ecological amplitude of deciduous tree species and differing patterns of agricultural land management at landscape and farm scales are discussed as possible explanations. Spruce regeneration was significantly explained by soil moisture and agricultural use as arable land followed by conversion to grassland. We conclude that spruce regeneration is a phenomenon characteristic not only for previously fertilized agricultural land but also for marginal agricultural land if the management ensures development of dense herbaceous layer. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Land cover maps are important tools for quantifying the human footprint on the environment and facilitate reporting and accounting to international agreements addressing the Sustainable Development Goals. Widely used European land cover maps such as CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) are produced at medium spatial resolutions (100 m) and rely on diverse data with complex workflows requiring significant institutional capacity. We present a 10 m resolution land cover map (ELC10) of Europe based on a satellite-driven machine learning work-flow that is annually updatable. A random forest classification model was trained on 70K ground-truth points from the LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey) dataset. Within the Google Earth Engine cloud computing environment, the ELC10 map can be generated from approx. 700 TB of Sentinel imagery within approx. 4 days from a single research user account. The map achieved an overall accuracy of 90% across eight land cover classes and could account for statistical unit land cover proportions within 3.9% (R2 = 0.83) of the actual value. These accuracies are higher than that of CORINE (100 m) and other 10 m land cover maps including S2GLC and FROM-GLC10. Spectro-temporal metrics that capture the phenology of land cover classes were most important in produc-ing high mapping accuracies. We found that the atmospheric correction of Sentinel-2 and the speckle filtering of Sentinel-1 imagery had a minimal effect on enhancing the classification accuracy (&lt; 1%). However, combining optical and radar imagery increased accuracy by 3% compared to Sen-tinel-2 alone and by 10% compared to Sentinel-1 alone. The addition of auxiliary data (terrain, climate and night-time lights) increased accuracy by an additional 2%. By using the centroid pixels from the LUCAS Copernicus module polygons we increased accuracy by &lt;1%, revealing that random forests are robust against contaminated training data. Furthermore, the model requires very little training data to achieve moderate accuracies—the difference between 5K and 50K LUCAS points is only 3% (86 vs. 89%). This implies that significantly less resources are necessary for making in situ survey data (such as LUCAS) suitable for satellite-based land cover classification. At 10 m resolution, the ELC10 map can distinguish detailed landscape features like hedgerows and gardens, and therefore holds potential for aerial statistics at the city borough level and monitoring property-level environmental interventions (e.g., tree planting). Due to the reliance on purely satellite-based input data, the ELC10 map can be continuously updated independent of any country-specific geo-graphic datasets. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Ground surface changes caused by freeze-thaw action affect agriculture and forestry, as well as artificial structures such as roads. In this study, an area is examined in which reforestation is urgently needed but the growth of naturally restored seedlings and planted trees is impaired by freeze-thaw action. Thus, a method of measuring freeze-thaw induced ground surface changes and mitigating their negative impacts is needed. Real-time kinematic unmanned aerial vehicle and structure-from-motion multiview stereophotogrammetry are used on slope-failure sites in forest areas to observe the ground surface changes caused by freeze-thaw action over a wide area, in a nondestructive manner. The slope characteristics influencing the ground-surface changes were examined, and it was confirmed that it is possible to observe minute topographical changes of less than ±5 cm resulting from freeze-thaw action. Statistical models show that the amount of freeze-thaw action is mostly linked to the cumulative solar radiation, daily ground-surface temperature range, and topographic-wetness index, which influence the microscale dynamics of the ground surface. The proposed method will be useful for future quantitative assessments of ground-surface conditions. Further, efficient reforestation could be implemented by considering the effects of the factors identified on the amount of freeze-thaw action. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Forest harvest, climate change, and their interaction can alter catchment peak discharges, which have ramifications for channel geomorphology and water quality. Catchments in the boreal-temperate transition zone may be especially vulnerable to these factors. We developed a new approach to peak flow analysis using two long-term, paired catchment experiments in that landscape at the Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF) in north-central Minnesota. We investigated how forest cover change affects the magnitude, occurrence probability, event decoupling, and seasonal decoupling of annual maximum peak flows. Event decoupling is when the annual maximum flows on control and treatment catchments occur in response to different events within a given year. Seasonal decoupling is when the annual maximum flows on control and treatment catchments occur in different seasons within a given year. Commonly used statistical methods (e.g., ANCOVA) support inferences only for effects on peak flow magnitude, disregarding effects on event occurrence probability. Statistical stationarity (i.e., time-invariant parameters) is generally assumed within the ANCOVA analysis, despite temporal changes in climatic and land cover controls. Further, use of these methods requires event coupling, which is not always valid for annual maximum flows in catchments with mixed precipitation regimes. To address these limitations, we developed new nonstationary flood-frequency analysis methods with Bayesian parameter estimation to analyze two harvesting experiments, including conversion from deciduous to coniferous species. We compared results from these models to traditional least-squares based methods (e.g., ANCOVA). We assessed event and seasonal decoupling using logistic regression with Bayesian parameter estimation. There was no effect of harvesting on the annual maximum flow according to ANCOVA and generalized least squares models, but these methods were not reliable due to the presence of outliers, and both event and seasonal decoupling. Flood-frequency results from one clearcutting experiment showed increases in the annual maximum flow across nearly all return intervals, with 80–85% confidence for peak discharges between the 10 and 50-year peak flow. The 50-year return interval peak increased from an expected 17 cfs to 34 cfs after harvest. Harvesting induced substantial event decoupling in the catchment pairs, and seasonal decoupling in one catchment pair. As forest cover regenerated, decoupling probability decreased. Our coupling analysis results indicated that control and treatment catchments generated and processed flood peaks differently after harvest, and explained the poor fit of the linear models for which we assumed event coupling. Our study calls into question several key assumptions of traditional linear models in the analysis of paired-catchments given certain conditions. For example, where forest harvesting can affect the season of annual maximum peaks, and thus the phase of the generating precipitation event (snowmelt versus rainfall), it changes the relationship between the catchment pair in a way not accounted for in traditional linear models. We advocate the use of probabilistic methods that can incorporate nonstationarity and are robust to different mechanisms of catchment hydrologic change in response to forest harvest. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There is deepening interest in how microclimatic refugia can reduce species threat, if suitable climatic conditions are maintained locally, despite global climate change. Microclimates are a particularly important consideration in topographically heterogeneous landscapes, while in some habitats, such as forests and woodlands, microclimates are also extremely labile and affected by management practices that could consequently be used to offset climate change impact. This study explored a conservation priority guild—cyanolichen epiphytes in temperate rainforest—quantifying the niche response to macroclimate, and landscape or woodland stand structures that determine the microclimate. Based on epiphyte survey in a core region of European temperate rainforest (western Scotland), a ‘random forest’ machine-learning model confirmed a strong cyanolichen response to summer dryness, as well as the effects of distance to running water, topographic heatload and tree species identity, which modify the local moisture regime and/or lichen growth rates. By quantifying this response to macroclimate, landscape and stand structures, it was possible to estimate an extent to which woodland may be expanded in the future, to offset a negative effect of increasing summer dryness projected through to the 2080s. Using current policy as a yardstick, sufficient woodland expansion could be delivered relatively quickly for median impacted sites, but with times to woodland delivery extending over 10, 20 and 25 years for sites at the 75th, 90th and 95th percentiles of cyanolichen decline. Furthermore, the extent of new woodland required, and delivery times, increase almost threefold on average, as new woodland becomes distributed over wider riparian zones. These contrasting implications emphasize an urgent need for afforestation that achieves targeted spatial planning responsive to microclimates as refugia. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Deep soil water is important for trees to combat droughts and thus is an important consideration for assessing sustainability of afforestation. However, the extent to which trees could depend on deep soil for root water uptake (RWU), remains poorly understood. Here we selected five apple orchards, planted in 2008, 2005, 2001, 1998 and 1994 (named A2008, A2005, A2001, A1998, and A1994, respectively) from the Chinese Loess Plateau and measured water isotopes from tree xylem and soil to the depth up to 23 m. We then used the Bayesian mixing model MixSIAR with dual isotopes (2H, 18O) to quantify the seasonal contribution ratio of each soil layer (0–0.4 m, 0.4–2 m, 2–5 m, and 5 m to maximum rooting depth) to RWU in normal years 2017, 2018 and wet year 2019. Results showed that with increasing orchard age, rooting depth increased from 10.2 m to 23.2 m, resulting in cumulative deep soil (below 5 m) water deficits from 74.5 mm in 9-year-old orchard to 1191.8 mm in 25-year-old orchard. And annual deep soil water below 5 m contributed 9–39% to the total RWU over the orchard lifetime. Although fine roots in shallow 0–2 m soils in old orchards A1998 and A1994 only accounted for 20% of that in the entire profiles, these roots contributed, on average, 64% of the total absorbed water in 2017–2019. Relative to the normal year, apple trees relied less on deep soil water in wet year. Our findings is of particular significance to the ongoing eco-restoration on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). © 2021

AB  - Insect damage to cones and seeds has a strong impact on the regeneration of conifer forest ecosystems, with broader implications for ecological and economic services. Lack of control of insect populations can lead to important economic and environmental losses. Pinus strobiformis is the most widespread of the white pines in Mexico and is widely distributed throughout the mountains of northern Mexico. Relatively few studies have examined insect damage to the cones and seeds of these pines, especially in Mexico. In this study, we therefore analyzed insect damage to cones and seeds of P. strobiformis in Mexico by using X-ray and stereomicroscopic analysis. The specific objectives of the study were (a) to characterize insect damage by measuring external and internal cone traits, (b) to assess the health of seeds and cones of P. strobiformis in the Sierra Madre Occidental, Mexico, and (c) to estimate the relative importance of the effects of different environmental variables on cone and seed damage caused by insects. We found that 80% of P. strobiformis seeds and 100% of the tree populations studied had damage caused by insects. Most seeds were affected by Leptoglossus occidentalis, Tetyra bipunctata, Megastigmus albifrons, and the Lepidoptera complex (which includes Apolychrosis synchysis, Cydia latisigna, Eucosma bobana, and Dioryctria abietivorella). The cones of all tree populations were affected by some type of insect damage, with Lepidoptera causing most of the damage (72%), followed by Conophthorus ponderosae (15%), the hemipteran L. occidentalis (7%), and the wasp M. albifrons (6%). The proportion of incomplete seeds in P. strobiformis at the tree level, cone damage by M. albifrons and seed damage in L. occidentalis were associated with various climate and soil variables and with crown dieback. Thus, cone and seed insect damage can be severe and potentially impact seed production in P. strobiformis and the reforestation potential of the species. The study findings will enable managers to better identify insects that cause damage to cone and seeds. In addition, identification of factors associated with damage may be useful for predicting the levels of insect predation on seeds and cones. © Copyright © 2021 Leal-Sáenz, Waring, Álvarez-Zagoya, Hernández-Díaz, López-Sánchez, Martínez-Guerrero and Wehenkel.

AB  - Agricultural intensification and abandonment of traditional uses have led to the degradation of Mediterranean oak landscapes, most apparent in a severe lack of tree regeneration. In the Alentejo region of Southwestern Portugal the landscape mosaic is composed of three prevalent land cover types: cork oak forests, open cork oak woodlands (montados) and shrublands dominated by Cistus ladanifer. The objective of this study is to understand how natural tree regeneration differs among these three land cover types and how stand characteristics and site conditions affect regeneration at each land cover type. We collected data on stand characteristics (adult tree layer), site conditions (topography, soil conditions, understory vegetation and light conditions) and tree regeneration (species composition, density, size structure), and analysed differences among the three land cover types. An information-theoretic approach and model averaging were applied to a set of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to identify stand characteristics and site conditions that best explain regeneration occurrence of cork oak (Quercus suber) and strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) at each land cover type. Our results show that regeneration failure was widespread at all land cover types, being strongest in shrublands. Regeneration density was higher in forests than in montados, and marginal in shrublands. Differences in regeneration patterns among land cover types seem to be related to differential processes of seed availability, seed dispersal and the availability of safe sites for recruit establishment, which are affected by vegetation cover and (past) land use practices. Cork oak regeneration was more likely to occur at steeper slopes in both forests and montados, with lower soil fertility and higher available water storage capacity in forests, and with higher proportion of ground cover in montados. In shrublands, cork oak regeneration was more likely to occur with higher soil fertility and rock content, and with less solar radiation. Regeneration of strawberry tree in forests was more likely to occur with lower available water storage capacity, and with the presence of adult strawberry trees, while in shrublands it was more likely to occur at flatter slopes. Overall, our results indicate that differences in cork oak and strawberry tree regeneration within land cover types seem to be a result of indirect effects of stand and site factors on competition and facilitation between tree recruits and coexisting plants. This study provides recommendations that can support sustainable management and restoration efforts in Mediterranean oak landscapes. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - As known already, Deforestation still continues to degrade the earth at an alarming rate, where it destroys the surrounding flora and fauna. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations it was estimated that between 2016 and 2020, the area of forest reduced from, 16 million hectares per year to 10 million hectares per year. The main and primary reason for this, is continuing to be the agricultural expansion and commercial production, which leads to loss of forest biodiversity. Almost 40 percent of the degradation is accounted to this factor. Looking into the bright side of forest it would bring around 86 million jobs, which would support the livelihood of many. In the world roughly around 870 million people spend time collecting wood for fuel (fuel-wood) to produce charcoal.One of the major effects caused by deforestation is the greenhouse effect, here the main gases namely CO2 (carbon-dioxide), CH4 (methane), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) and cholofloro carbons. These gases trap the sunlight which fall in the IR range, this disturbs the equilibrium of the earth. In addition to this cutting trees also release CO2, adding to the rigid hold of these gases on the earth, which ultimately lead to the warming of the earth, this is very dangerous for humans and many lifeforms on earth.In this paper a novel solution to counter the problem of deforestation using drones and deep learning techniques has been proposed. The main reason of considering drones for this purpose is that it is fast as compared to traditional manual labor (almost 9 times faster), which saves time and improves efficiency. Moreover, a drone being unmanned avoids any risk of human danger, this method can be best suited for area effected by natural disaster like a forest fire in remote area, where people cannot travel, make reforestation at those areas relatively easy. Also, this method can be extended towards monitoring of the number of trees in a locality making it easier to keep tracks of the areas of interest. Moreover, with an expert steering the operations of seed dispersion, appropriate areas of sowing seeds can be found in different topologies with an advantage of object detection at these areas. Here a Mobile Net architecture is proposed and implemented for object detection using raspberry pi, which is embedded in the drone along with a seed dispenser, which will be used to sow the seeds at the barren or "deforested land". © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - In the last century, bottomland hardwood (BLH) forests throughout the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley in the United States declined >80% and have been degraded because of habitat loss, fragmentation, and altered hydrology. To better understand how current conditions in BLH forest systems influence wildlife and to better manage land use and vegetation, we characterized winter (Dec–Mar) multi-scale habitat selection of 75 radio-marked swamp rabbits (Sylvilagus aquaticus) based on 850 locations in southern Illinois, USA, during 2010–2016. We investigated habitat selection by fitting resource selection functions with generalized linear mixed models based on Euclidean distances (km) to 8 cover types that described hydrogeomorphic conditions. At the second-order scale of selection (home range selection), swamp rabbits were closer to deciduous forest and low-elevation BLH and farther from agriculture, permanent water, shallow BLH, and woody wetland. At the third-order scale of selection (habitat selection within the home range), swamp rabbits selected areas closer to deciduous forest, low BLH, and shallow BLH, and farther from woody wetlands. For the swamp rabbit in Illinois, a BLH specialist at the northern extent of their range, habitat selection is limited to available terrestrial habitat that provides vegetation for food and hiding cover within linear and flood-prone BLH corridors surrounded by agricultural cover types that are largely unsuitable as habitat. Because hydrologic conditions are spatially and temporally dynamic, wildlife managers should focus on providing diverse habitat conditions across elevations that ensure the continuous availability of terrestrial habitat regardless of water level and flooding extent across the BLH landscape. Further reforestation efforts in BLH ecosystems should target current agricultural land on higher elevations adjacent to characteristically flood-prone forest remnants that escaped agricultural clearing due to frequent flooding. © 2021 The Wildlife Society. © 2021 The Wildlife Society

AB  - Deforestation in the recent times is proving to be a major threat towards destabilizing the earth natural cycles. Due to reduction of trees the earth undergoes the phenomenon of 'Green House Effect', wherein the greenhouse gases majorly carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen dioxide and chlorofloro carbons, traps the sun's light (IR range) in the atmosphere more than required to maintain an equilibrium, which cause the earth to heat up, proving fatal for life forms on earth. When trees are cut down the carbon dioxide which they store to maintain an equilibrium will now be released in to the earth atmosphere, which adds to the cause. The main contributors towards the greenhouse gases are the agriculture and forestry activities. These include forest fires, tree chopping for agriculture and husbandry, urban sprawling and logging of trees. Due, to these activities the mother nature is slowly losing its capacity to reforest and existing tools and nursey supply chains are largely inadequate to fill the gap, and this is the challenge we would like to address using our project 'Reforestation using drone and deep learning'. We study about how drones and be used for reforestation and making a working prototype of the same. Using drone reforestation, we can tackle a multitude of problems like, it is 9 times faster than other human planting systems, staying airborne, allows efficient and quick travelling, saving time and coverage if more area in less time and more efficiency. We look into the future scope wherein we also devise a method where deep learning techniques can be used efficiently for tracking deforested land by a drone and sowing the required seeds at that exact location by hovering to that point or dropping the seed airborne. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - The question of the most suitable forest tree species for defined area and landscape has been investigated in the paper. A set of classifiers is constructed in order to build relations between type of soil and other features of forest area and preferable species of trees. The decision tree classifiers, ensemble methods implementing bagging and boosting over such trees are used. The machine learning methods are implemented to obtain the best suited tree species to cover given forest area. This classification task is one of very important problems of forest regeneration process. Efforts of ecologists can have better results if there are expert systems allowing to understand the best forest cover type for areas of forest fires or deforestation that takes place because of human factor. Results and conclusions of this paper can be used in processing of other forest recover tasks. The same methods can be implemented in order to get the preferable tree species for different areas if there's enough data to solve these tasks with machine learning technique. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Multiple studies have shown that invasive plants pose great challenges to forest regeneration at local spatial scales; however, little is known about how those local-scale impacts of invasive plants may collectively influence forest regeneration at a regional scale. In this study, we hypothesized that invasive plants influence forest regeneration across southern US forests by altering tree seedling and sapling abundance and diversity. We used a total of 52,690 southern US forestland plots surveyed between 2015 and 2019 by the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service. We compiled presence/absence data from 16 major invasive plant taxa and calculated the number, richness, and diversity of seedlings and saplings for all major tree species present in the dataset. We used Generalized Linear Models to examine the relationship of the selected invasive plants to tree seedlings and saplings. We then used principal component analysis to evaluate whether negative relationships appeared to be related to niche differences. We found that the presence of invasive plants generally was negatively associated with tree seedling and sapling abundance, and that these negative interactions appeared to be independent of niche associations. Moreover, fast-growing hardwood tree species had the fewest negative species-wise associations with invasive plants, which suggests that the influence of plant invasions on forest regeneration may be partly mediated by the functional traits of regenerating tree species. We also found that the invasive plants evaluated in this study differentially influenced seedling versus sapling abundance and diversity, which could have complex implications for decision-making related to forest management strategies. Ultimately, the potential impact of these invasive plants on tree regeneration is likely to hamper the sustainable management of southern US forests (natural and managed) by the reduction of extant biodiversity. Thus, invasive plants should be incorporated into management strategies to help ensure the persistence of native forest communities and the ecological services they provide. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Negative intraspecific interactions could provide opportunities for heterospecific regeneration, thereby maintaining species coexistence in forest communities. Increasing conspecific tree and seedling neighbor densities often have negative correlations with seedling survival. If and how the strength of interactions change with seedling age remains a knowledge gap. In this study, we followed 2184 newly germinated seedlings belonging to 26 species for five years in a subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest in eastern China. We tested the density distribution pattern of different aged live seedlings and used generalized linear mixed models to assess the dynamic influence of conspecific tree and seedling neighbors on seedlings survival across years. Our results showed that the density distribution of newly germinated seedlings was more clustered than the other aged live seedlings. Over five years, the clustered density distribution of live seedlings gradually weakened. Particularly, the density distribution of five years old seedlings was statistically random. Meanwhile, the degree of positive correlation between the density of live seedlings and the density of conspecific tree neighbors decreased with seedling age. Correspondingly, the conspecific seedling neighbors had a significant negative correlation with newly germinated seedlings survival in the first year and had a greater effect than conspecific tree neighbor density. As seedlings age, the conspecific tree neighbors had a greater negative relative effect on seedlings survival than the conspecific seedling neighbors. Our findings demonstrate that intraspecific negative interactions are an important mechanism on seedling survival and the magnitude of those interactions change with seedling age. In younger seedlings, intraspecific negative interactions were mainly from conspecific seedling neighbors and weakened as the seedlings aged. In later seedling ages, the interactions from conspecific tree neighbors dominated. Ultimately, these effects reduce species clumping dynamically and provide space for establishment of heterospecifics which would maintain diversity in the forest. © 2021

AB  - Mast seeding in conifers is characterized by the spatially synchronous and temporally variable production of seed cone crops. Large mast seeding events (known as “mast years”) can be a visually stunning and ecologically important phenomenon, supporting trophic interactions and survival of seed predators as well as forest regeneration. Documenting patterns in mast seeding is generally labor-intensive, requiring repeated visual cone counts at consistent and widespread locations over long periods to quantify the spatiotemporal variability of cone production. Our goal in this work was to evaluate the correspondence of multispectral vegetation indexes (VIs) from Landsat with ground-based observations of mast seeding in white spruce (Picea glauca) forests of the Kluane region, Yukon, Canada. Given the visual characteristics of mast seeding in white spruce, we tested: 1) whether photosynthesis- and color-oriented VIs can identify senescence of spruce cones in late summer and autumn during mast years, and 2) if moisture-oriented VIs can distinguish the significant drying of seed cones from the surrounding spruce canopy vegetation during that senescence and after seeds are released. We hypothesized that the slope of late season decline in VIs in spruce forests would be related to masting (i.e., greater decline in VI during mast years). Using generalized linear mixed-effects modeling (GLMM), we compared more than 100 site-year combinations of mast/non-mast observations to develop VI-based regressions. We found some success identifying mast years with moisture-oriented VIs, while models using the photosynthesis- and color-oriented VIs were not supported, given the data. However, we found that models containing multiple VIs from both categories were more successful than any single-VI model, accurately predicting four of sixteen mast events in site observations. We provide compelling evidence that mast-seeding patterns may be detectable using moisture-oriented Landsat observations over large coniferous forest areas. Additional work is warranted to distinguish the signal for mast events from confounding disturbance-related effects and to differentiate variation in VI signals attributable to masting productivity in contrast to effects of climatological variability on reflectance. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Forest structure and biomass production of Kandelia obovata Sheue, H.Y.Liu &amp; J.Yong mangrove plantations in Northern Viet Nam were investigated for 1- to 20-year-old stands. The measurements were implemented over the study plots which were set up in 1-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, 18-, 19- and 20-year-old K. obovata plantations. Tree density, stem diameter at 30 cm height (D0.3) and tree height (H) were measured. These parameters increased with stand age from young to mature stage with the ranges from 3,700 ± 1,609 tree.ha−1 to 26,500 ± 1,153 tree.ha−1, 0.67 ± 0.18 cm to 8.73 ± 3.16 cm, and 0.46 ± 0.16 m to 4.12 ± 0.96 m for density, stem diameter at 30 cm height and stem height, respectively. Fifty trees were harvested to find an allometric relationship between tree size and dry mass. Allocation models were developed to estimate above ground biomass. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the root mean square error (RMSE), R2, and P-value of the models were calculated and compared to find the fitness models for biomass evaluation. The best correlation satisfied between D0.3*H and dry mass of tree components and total above ground biomass (AGB). Our results showed a rise in above ground biomass of 1- to 20-year-old K. obovata plantations, which ranges from 0.04 ± 0.02 Mg ha−1 to 115.39 ± 15.34 Mg ha−1. Of this, ~87% of the above ground biomass was represented by stems and branches. Above ground biomass and its components linearly increased with stand age. It was found that the biomass in the study area increased with an annual rate of 4.33 Mg ha−1 yr−1. These results provide a view of mangrove plantations in assessing the biomass of mangroves continuously from young to mature stages of reforestation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Insect herbivory on seedling leaves is one of the most important factors driving seedling growth and mortality in natural forests, which sets the pivotal roles of insect herbivory in affecting natural forest regeneration and species composition. The intensity of herbivory can be influenced by multiple biotic and abiotic factors affecting leaf detection or consumption by insect herbivores. However, the relative importance of these biotic and abiotic factors in affecting insect herbivory and their interactions remain largely unknown in species-rich forests. We measured insect herbivory on seedling young leaves across 600 1 m × 1 m seedling plots in a subtropical forest. Effects of nine seedling traits, neighboring plant compositions, soil moisture, and light availability on young leaf damage by insect herbivores were assessed with generalized linear mixed-effects models. We found that seedling traits associated with plant size (young leaf area and seedling height), leaf nutrition or defense (leaf thickness, carbon content, and stem specific length) explained more of the variation in insect herbivory than the biotic and abiotic environmental factors. Young leaf coloration (delayed greening degree) exhibited contrasting effects on leaf damage at wet vs. dry sites, so did seedling trait diversity (functional dispersion, FDis). The risk of insect herbivory increased with leaf redness and decreased with seedling FDis at wet sites, while the opposite trends were observed at dry sites. Our study advances the understanding on the driving factors of insect herbivory on seedling leaves in species-rich forests and suggests that the alleviating effects of plant diversity on insect herbivory were stronger at wet conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The worldwide increase in anthropogenic disturbances imposed by the expansion of land use practices has important effects on vegetation dynamics and animal communities. The North American boreal forest is no exception to this global trend, and there are growing concerns regarding the persistence of linear anthropogenic features across Canada because of their negative impacts on wildlife and, particularly, on threatened species such as the boreal caribou. While many recent studies have investigated the state and distribution of regeneration on seismic lines in the western part of the country, few studies have characterized the natural regrowth of logging roads, the main type of anthropogenic linear features found in eastern Canada. As seismic lines and logging roads are structurally different, results from seismic line studies may not be easily generalized to logging roads. In this study, we therefore 1) assessed the influence of different characteristics on vegetation regrowth composition and 2) determined which environmental drivers may compromise natural regrowth on logging roads. We tested these questions using data collected from 56 1-km long road segments distributed in three different regions across Québec's boreal forest (eastern Canada). We used a canonical correspondence analysis to characterize the species composition of vegetation regrowth on logging roads and used mixed regression models to assess the influence of different biotic and abiotic variables on regrowth establishment. The number of growing degree-days and the proportion of coniferous stands in the surroundings of a road segment explained most of the variation in species composition of the vegetation on roads. Regrowth composition on roads was distributed along a gradient shifting from a high number of alder stems (in the region with a higher number of degree-days) and a smaller proportion of coniferous stands (surrounding the road segment) to a higher number of coniferous stems in regions experiencing less growing degree-days where road segments were surrounded by a greater proportion of coniferous stands. Soil compaction was the most important variable impeding the establishment of vegetation on logging roads. A greater proportion of wetlands surrounding the road segment also contributed to poor regrowth. Our results underline the slow rate of passive regeneration of logging roads and the importance of road surface decommissioning, which should include tree planting, in the context of woodland caribou habitat restoration. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Regenerating forests after agricultural land abandonment are increasingly common in human-modified tropical landscapes. These secondary forests preserve biodiversity and provide multiple ecosystem services, but such important roles depend on their recovery rates, which can be difficult to predict. Recovery is expected to occur faster when landscape composition favors seed dispersal to the regenerating site, and when previous land-use does not significantly reduce propagule bank or future plant growth. Here, we test such expectations for the recovery of a Mexican tropical dry forest during secondary succession. For this purpose, we measured several indicators of landscape composition and site land-use intensity in 30 regenerating sites located along gradients of age of abandonment and amount of surrounding forest. Generalized linear models and redundancy analysis were fitted to test if values of four vegetation properties (aboveground biomass, total and dominant species diversity, and species composition) were indicative of such effects. We found evidence that, as expected, species richness recovers faster in sites surrounded by higher forest cover, while aboveground biomass recovers slower as surrounding pasture cover increases. Species composition was also significantly but poorly explained by the interaction between age of abandonment and the amount of forest cover. Contrary to our expectations, we found weak evidence on the impact of site land-use intensity on all vegetation properties, except on the number of dominant species, which showed higher values in sites with higher land-use intensity. Our findings show that landscape context plays a major role in structuring successional plant communities in this tropical dry region, even stronger than site land-use intensity. This seems to be related to the influence of landscape patterns on dispersal and recruitment limitation, but also on the likelihood of further human disturbances. Therefore, conserving landscape quality is paramount to enhance forest recovery and its contribution to the preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Increased human activities such as commodity-led deforestation, extension of agriculture, urbanization, and wildfires are major drivers of forest loss worldwide. In Cameroon, these activities cause a loss of suitable primate habitat and could ultimately threaten the survival of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We derived independent estimates of the population size of the Endangered Nigeria–Cameroon chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) in Kom-Wum Forest Reserve, Cameroon, and surrounding unprotected forest areas through 1) direct observations, 2) camera trapping, 3) distance sampling, 4) marked nest counts, and 5) standing crop nest counts. In addition, we georeferenced signs of chimpanzee and human activity along line transects. We used a generalized linear mixed model to predict the occurrence of chimpanzees in response to edge length (measured as the perimeter of core forest patches), core area of forest patches (measured as area of forest patches beyond an edge width of 100 m), habitat perforation (measured as the perimeter of nonforested landscape within core forest patches), patch size(measured as area of forest patches), and forest cover. Chimpanzee density estimates ranged from 0.1 (direct observation) to 0.9 (distance sampling) individuals km−2 depending on estimation method with a mean nest group size of 7 ± 5.4 (SD). The mean encounter rate for signs of chimpanzee activity was significantly higher in mature forests (2.3 signs km−1) than in secondary forests (0.3 signs km−1) and above 1000 m elevation (4.0 signs km−1) than below 1000 m (1.0 signs km−1). The mean encounter rate for signs of human activity was significantly higher in secondary (8.0 signs km−1) than in mature forests (0.9 signs km−1). Secondary forests, habitat perforation, and edge length had a significant negative effect on the occurrence of chimpanzee signs. Overall, human activity and forest degradation affected the number of observed chimpanzee signs negatively. Regular antipoaching patrols and reforestation programs in degraded areas could potentially reduce threats to populations of endangered species and may increase suitable habitat area. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Accounting for climate change in reforestation practices has the potential to be one of the most efficacious adaptation strategies for maintaining future forest ecosystem services. There is a rich literature projecting spatial shifts in climatic suitability for tree species and strong scientific evidence for the necessity of assisted migration. However, there has been limited translation of this research into operational reforestation, due in part to mismatches to the information needs of practitioners. Here, we describe a practitioner-focused climate change informed tree species selection (CCISS) model to support reforestation decisions in British Columbia (BC). CCISS projects the climate change redistribution of bioclimate units from the multi-scaled Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC) system with machine-learning for 90 modelled futures. It leverages the reforestation knowledge from BEC to make site-specific species projections of reforestation feasibility with climate change uncertainty metrics. We present 21st-century feasibility projections for a comprehensive set of tree species native to western North America. Some general trends are evident: augmentation of the number of feasible species in sub-boreal regions due to the rapid expansion of feasibility for temperate species; attrition at low elevations in southern BC due to declines in the feasibility of native species with little compensation by non-native species; and turnover at mid-elevations as declining feasibility for subalpine species is compensated by uphill expansion of climatic feasibility for submontane species. Edaphic (soil) factors are important; feasibility declines are higher on relatively dry sites than on wetter sites for most species. Our analysis emphasizes that changes in feasibility are species-specific, spatially variable, and influenced by edaphic site factors. By employing the multi-scaled BEC system that currently informs operational reforestation, CCISS facilitates translation of research into actionable guidance for practitioners. © 2020

AB  - Most of the West African forests have disappeared or have been deeply fragmented. This deforestation dynamic is still ongoing under a strong demographic pressure, forests being mostly replaced by agricultural lands. On the other hand, some reforestation projects are also undertaken, in particular by planting non-native species like Cedrela odorata. To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the causes and consequences of Cedrela odorata spread in West African natural forests. We studied a 400ha area of natural forest where 100ha of permanent plots have been affected by a major fire in 1983. Within these permanent plots, 21,444 trees were mapped, botanically determined and their diameters at breast height were measured in 2018. Using a bayesian hierarchical framework, we modelled the causes of the spread of Cedrela odorata in the studied plots, and its consequences on aboveground biomass and tree community diversity. Regarding the causes, the occurrence of Cedrela odorata is significantly linked to the fire occurence 25 years ago, to the proximity of the forest edge and to the presence of hydromorphic soils. Regarding the consequences, Cedrela odorata invasion doesn’t have any significant impact on the above-ground biomass but has a strong negative effect on the tree community diversity, as far as decreasing Simpson diversity in Hill numbers from 27 equivalent species in slightly invaded plots to 2 equivalent species in largely invaded plots. Our results highlight the long-lasting impacts of human disturbance (fire, Cedrela odorata introduction) on forest ecosystems and the need to use local species for ongoing reforestation plans in West African semi-deciduous forests. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Currently, with a global warming problem, most developing countries such as Mexico or Brazil suffer high levels of deforestation, which directly threatened bird species that have their habitats linked to different tree species. The forests disappear, and hundreds of species disappear along with them. The geography institute of the UNAM estimates that each year more than 500 thousand hectares of forest and rain forest in different parts of the World are lost, placing Mexico in fifth place in global deforestation. That is why it is important to find the definitive factors that influence deforestation; its discovery is key to help promote the prevention of excessive logging, conservation, and continuous reforestation. The use of deep learning and satellite imagery is considered useful to simulate deforestation processes and in the analysis of these factors to determine their reduction. In this research, our objective is to use deep learning to model the effects of deforestation on habitats of bird species with arboreal ecosystems; this will allow us to determine areas in danger of extinction. We plan to simulate an affected area, to be able to visualize over time, through the numerical prediction and the fading of the forest area, and then predict where the next area in danger will be, in order to reduce the effects of this ecological problem. The main problem of deforestation lies not only in the reduction of forests but also in the habitat of different species. Using an innovative artificial intelligence technique such as Deep Learning. We can adequately characterize longitudinal changes in terms of trends in the reduction of this type of locations that require an animal species to survive. There are 10,087 different species of birds that live in diverse habitats; 47.82% have an arboreal habitat, a reason very important and decisive to our study. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Remote Sensing plays a critical role in forest tree species identification. Regarding the current debate on earth observation and monitoring, many see this valuable technology useful for a wide range of purposes, including forest conservation and management. This paper focuses on a workflow for mapping forest tree species from satellite images, by statistic algorithms and machine learning. Among the world satellite platforms, the Sentinel-2 program was selected to investigate the mixed forest area of Monte Sant’Angelo in Central Italy. A list of monthly images from 2018 to 2020 have been processed using the Google Earth Engine geospatial processing service. The process includes the computation of vegetation indexes like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Transformed Difference Vegetation Index (TDVI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI). A forest class time series was generated for each index. The Artificial Intelligence algorithm models (Machine Learning) were trained identifying accurate ground truths. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to reduce variables redundancy in Random Forest classifications. Four forest categories have been identified: holm oak woodlands, conifer reforestation, Ostryo Carpinion alliance and mixed hardwood forest. Due to the phenological differences among species, the classification global accuracy ranges from 70% to 80%. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - As labour for manual tree planting becomes scarcer, regeneration costs are steadily increasing in Nordic forestry. Today’s intermittently advancing tree planting machines provide excellent silvicultural results, but are expensive to operate because of poor productivity. In contrast, continuously advancing planting machines, thanks to high productivities, are increasingly being regarded as a solution to these runaway regeneration costs. The Silva Nova was a historical, continuously advancing tree planting machine with high productivity. However, Silva Nova’s weaknesses included high labour costs (it required two operators) and the random nature of how it chose planting spots. In contrast, SuperSilva, a purely conceptual modernisation of Silva Nova, involves both automation and microsite identification to make the machine more efficient. We used discrete-event simulation to analyse the stocking rate and spatial distribution of tree planting with SuperSilva. The simulation results showed that introducing sensors for identifying suitable microsites will allow continuously advancing planting machines (like SuperSilva) to plant seedlings in a numerically and spatially adequate manner on moraine soils. Hence, these sensors will increase the competitiveness and versatility of tree planting machines. Unfortunately, such reliable and robust sensor technology (unaffected by a wide variety of operating conditions) is not yet commercially available. © 2021 Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

AB  - Research Highlights: Modelling species’ distribution and productivity is key to support integrated landscape planning, species’ afforestation, and sustainable forest management. Background and Objectives: Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton) forests in Portugal were lately affected by wildfires and measures to overcome this situation are needed. The aims of this study were: (1) to model species’ spatial distribution and productivity using a machine learning (ML) regression approach to produce current species’ distribution and productivity maps; (2) to model the species’ spatial productivity using a stochastic sequential simulation approach to produce the species’ current productivity map; (3) to produce the species’ potential distribution map, by using a ML classification approach to define species’ ecological envelope thresholds; and (4) to identify present and future key factors for the species’ afforestation and management. Materials and Methods: Spatial land cover/land use data, inventory, and environmental data (climate, topography, and soil) were used in a coupled ML regression and stochastic sequential simulation approaches to model species’ current and potential distributions and productivity. Results: Maritime pine spatial distribution modelling by the ML approach provided 69% fitting efficiency, while species productivity modelling achieved only 43%. The species’ potential area covered 60% of the country’s area, where 78% of the species’ forest inventory plots (1995) were found. The change in the Maritime pine stands’ age structure observed in the last decades is causing the species’ recovery by natural regeneration to be at risk. Conclusions: The maps produced allow for best site identification for species afforestation, wood production regulation support, landscape planning considering species’ diversity, and fire hazard mitigation. These maps were obtained by modelling using environmental covariates, such as climate attributes, so their projection in future climate change scenarios can be performed. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Following the nuclear disaster of 1986, forests have established throughout the abandoned agricultural landscapes within Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (ChEZ). However, they are yet to be monitored properly. Their biometrical parameters need a robust assessment considering climate change mitigation potential and wildfire-induced risks. To predict basal area (BA) and growing stock volume (GSV) of these forests using spatially explicit approach, we utilized Sentinel-2 satellite data and three types of machine learning models (k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)). Root mean square error among all models ranged between 5.2 m2 ha−1 (49% of the mean) and 7.2 m2 ha−1 (71% of the mean), derived for BA by the GBM and k-NN models, respectively. While total and mean estimates of forest attributes were quite similar within an entire ChEZ, GBM approach outperformed other methods by predicting GSV more precisely when compared to local reference data. At the same time, k-NN approach has shown better performance in terms of preserving the initial empirical distribution and semivariation patterns. We concluded that k-NN method should be used for the spatial predictions of forest attributes, however, with a specific focus given on the training data set quality and profound model validation. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - After implementations of many economic and forestry policies during recent 30 years, forest cover in China has experienced significant changes. The fine scale and long-term information on forest temporary (disturbance) loss, persistent loss (deforestation), and gains (afforestation/reforestation) will provide a guide for forest management and policies at regional scale. Using Jiangxi Province as a pilot study region, here we assessed forest cover dynamics in the subtropical China during 1986-2019 by integrating time-series Landsat images, Landsat-based Detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery algorithm and Random Forest classifier on the Google Earth Engine Platform. The accuracy assessment indicated a high overall accuracy (>90%) and Kappa coefficient (>0.9) for both forest gain and loss detections as evaluated against various sources of plot-level sample data and the existing global forest change product. The total forest loss area was 18 697.79 km2, with persistent loss area of 3394.31 km2 due to land conversion during 1986-2019, while persistent (net) forest gain area was 45 656.96 km2, accounting for 57.70% of the forest area in 1986. Forest loss area exhibited large interannual variations, but showed a general increase trend from 1986 to 2019. The annual variation patterns of forest gain and loss area were associated with the changes in forestry policies and large disturbance events. Our assessments on the long-term and fine scale forest dynamic patterns will help evaluate the effectiveness of forest management practices and forestry polices on forest resource sustainability, and climate change and greenhouse gases mitigation in Jiangxi Province and China. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - We conducted a national survey on a high-quality internet panel to study landscape preferences in Norway, using photos as stimuli. We examined preference heterogeneity with respect to socio-demographic characteristics and latent topics brought up by the respondents, using ordinal logistic regression and structural topic modelling (STM), a machine learning-based analysis. We found that pasture landscapes are the most favoured (55%), while densely planted spruce forests are the least favoured (8%). The contrast was particularly strong between eastern and western Norway, between men and women, and between young and old. STM revealed that the choices were mainly driven by the preference for landscape openness, especially by women. Other important drivers were concerns regarding reforestation of former farmlands, aesthetic properties, forest management, biodiversity issues, and cultural values. Our results suggest that landscape policies may clash with socio-cultural preferences, and failure to account for these may undermine the success of a policy. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Mapping aboveground woody biomass (AGB) on abandoned agricultural land (AAL) is required by relevant stakeholders to monitor the spatial dynamics of farmland afforestation, to assess the carbon sequestration, and to set the appropriate management of natural resources. The objective of this study was, therefore, to present and assess a workflow consisting of (1) the spatial identification of AAL based on a combination of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, cadastral data, and Land Parcel Identification System data, and (2) the prediction of AGB on AAL using an areabased approach and a nonparametric random forest (RF) model based on a combination of field and ALS data. Part of the second objective was also to evaluate the applicability of (1) the authordeveloped algorithm for the calculation of ALS metrics and (2) a single comprehensive RF model for the whole area of interest. The study was conducted in the forest management unit Vígľaš (Slovakia, Central Europe) covering a total area of 12,472 ha. Specifically, five reference areas consisting of 11,194 reference points were used to assess the accuracy of the spatial identification of AAL, and seventy-five ground reference plots were used for the development of the ALS-based AGB model and for assessing the accuracy of the AGB map. The overall accuracy of the spatial identification of AAL was found to be 93.00% (Cohen’s kappa = 0.82). The difference between ALSpredicted and ground-observed AGB reached a relative root mean square error (RMSE) at 26.1%, 33.1%, and 21.3% for the whole sample size, plots dominated by shrub species, and plots dominated by tree species, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - China's forest area is wide, and the plantation area ranks first in the world. Masson Pine is one of the widely distributed afforestation varieties of trees in China. Obtaining morphological indexes of Masson Pine seedlings is helpful to select excellent afforestation seedlings and further improve the afforestation effect of seedlings. In order to realize the rapid and accurate evaluation of morphological indexes of Masson Pine seedlings a set of nondestructive detection system for morphological indexes of Masson Pine seedlings was designed, which integrated machine vision technology and machine learning technology. Firstly, an image acquisition hardware experimental platform is established and the camera is calibrated; then the software system performs preprocessing, image correction, stereo matching and other operations on the collected seedling image sequence to obtain the spatial point cloud information of the seedlings; finally, the three-dimensional model of Masson Pine seedlings is obtained after reconstructing the surface of the spatial point cloud by using the triangulation algorithm; and then the relevant SVR calculation is used to calibratte the accurate morphological indexes of Masson Pine seedlings quickly and non destructively. © 2020 IEEE

AB  - Forming a backbone of the wood supply in Vietnam, approximately 50% of plantation areas are managed by individual households. Of the planted species, the Acacia (Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn. ex Benth. × Acacia mangium Willd) hybrid is one of the most preferred by timber growers. Yet, information on the potential of this timber species for rural livelihoods is lacking. Taking Nam Dong and Phu Loc districts in Thua Thien Hue province as case studies, this paper aimed to explore the (i) characteristics of small-scale Acacia hybrid timber producers; (ii) contribution of Acacia hybrid timber production and commercialization to rural livelihoods; and (iii) socio-economic and contextual factors which determine the income from Acacia hybrid timber. We applied a mixed-methods approach including review of secondary data, interviews of 26 key informants, eight focus group discussions, direct observations and a survey of 300 Acacia hybrid producer households selected through multistage and purposive sampling. Qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed using thematic, descriptive and inferential statistics, such as variance analysis, correlation analysis and Bayesian model average (BMA) analysis. The results demonstrated the diversity of socio-economic characteristics, resource access and management as well as determinants of timber income of small-scale timber producers between the cases. Accounting for 33–56% of total household income, Acacia hybrid timber plantations played a crucial role in the current livelihood system. Nevertheless, timber income was skewed toward the wealth status of timber producers and ranged between 327 USD/household and 3387 USD/household in Nam Dong and between 397 USD/household and 9460 USD/household in Phu Loc district. Despite the substantial contribution the income from Acacia hybrid plantations could make to local poverty reduction, it was the main contributor to the overall income inequality. While this income source reduced the Gini coefficient by 1% in Nam Dong, it increased the Gini coefficient by 18% in Phu Loc district. Our study can be of interest for further policy interventions focusing on sustainable reforestation and livelihood development in Vietnam. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Forests play an important role in both regional and global C cycles. However, the spatial patterns of biomass C density and underlying factors in Northeast Asia remain unclear. Here, we characterized spatial patterns and important drivers of biomass C density for Northeast Asia, based on multisource data from in situ forest inventories, as well as remote sensing, bioclimatic, topographic, and human footprint data. We derived, for the first time, high-resolution (1 km × 1 km) maps of the current and future forest biomass C density for this region. Based on these maps, we estimated that current biomass C stock in northeastern China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Republic of Korea to be 2.53, 0.40, and 0.35 Pg C, respectively. Biomass C stock in Northeast Asia has increased by 20%–46% over the past 20 years, of which 40%–76% was contributed by planted forests. We estimated the biomass C stock in 2080 to be 6.13 and 6.50 Pg C under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, which exceeded the present region-wide C stock value by 2.85–3.22 Pg C, and were 8%–14% higher than the baseline C stock value (5.70 Pg C). The spatial patterns of biomass C densities were found to vary greatly across the Northeast Asia, and largely decided by mean diameter at breast height, dominant height, elevation, and human footprint. Our results suggest that reforestation and forest conservation in Northeast Asia have effectively expanded the size of the carbon sink in the region, and sustainable forest management practices such as precision forestry and close forest monitoring for fire and insect outbreaks would be important to maintain and improve this critical carbon sink for Northeast Asia. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Prescribed burning is widely used to mitigate the effects of severe fires across the landscape and to maintain biodiversity. Just like wildfires, the severity of prescribed burns can vary; this study was an opportunistic investigation. In one fortnight during autumn months of 2012, several prescribed burns were carried out in heathy-dry forests of central Victoria, Australia. We used measurements of canopy scorch, bark burn and ground cover burn to calculate a severity score for each site. The severity scores across sites ranged from low (2.5) to high (10). A before-after control-impact (BACI) design was utilised to model the potential impacts of fire and fire severity on birds. We used generalised linear mixed models (GLMM's), and incorporated first- and second-year post-fire spring/summer observations from 2012 to 2014, against bird data from observations carried out in 2010. The total combined abundances of individual species showed that broadly, bird abundance rebounded to pre-burn levels by the second spring post-fire. There was little response detected in either species richness or turnover. The muted turnover result aligns to other studies that indicate a scarcity of early-successional-stage species in eucalyptus forests and woodlands that rapidly regenerate post-fire. Ten individual species were also examined, and only one species, the White-throated Treecreeper (Cormobates leucophaea), responded to both fire and its severity. The BACI design was informative in illustrating that while the forest birds were resilient to small-scale prescribed burns of any severity, abundances in general may have been in decline, a result aligning with the years of reduced rainfall in the region. © 2020

AB  - In post-disturbance areas, salvage logging is a common management practice that can negatively affect ecosystem services and alter successional pathways of natural regeneration. In this study, we aim to investigate the effects of salvage logging in post-fire areas on the regeneration and height of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) on dry-poor, wet-poor, and peat soils. We used the Poisson generalised linear mixed-effects model and linear mixed-effect model to assess the effects of salvage logging on the abundance and height of Scots pine. In all forest types in post-fire areas, Scots pine and birch (Betula pendula Roth and Betula pubescens Ehrh.) were the most common tree species, accounting for 70–100% of the total regeneration abundance. Salvage logging resulted in significantly higher abundance of Scots pine only on mesic-peat soil. Mean height of Scots pine was significantly lower in stands with larger abundance of remnant living trees. In our study, we did not find conclusive evidence of negative effects of salvage logging on the abundance and height of Scots pine. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The phenotype of trees is determined by the relationships and interactions among genetic and environmental influences. Understanding the patterns and processes that are responsible for phenotypic variation is facilitated by studying the relationships between phenotype and the environment among many individuals across broad ecological and climatic gradients. We used Pinus strobiformis, which has a wide latitudinal distribution, as a model species to: (a) estimate the relative importance of different environmental factors in predicting these morphological traits and (b) characterize the spatial patterns of standing phenotypic variation of cone and seed traits across the species’ range. A large portion of the total variation in morphological characteristics was explained by ecological, climatic and geographical variables (54.7% collectively). The three climate, vegetation and geographical variable groups, each had similar total ability to explain morphological variation (43.4%, 43.8%, 51.5%, respectively), while the topographical variable group had somewhat lower total explanatory power (36.9%). The largest component of explained variance (33.6%) was the four-way interaction of all variable sets, suggesting that there is strong covariation in environmental, climate and geographical variables in their relationship to morphological traits of southwest white pine across its range. The regression results showed that populations in more humid and warmer climates expressed greater cone length and seed size. This may in part facilitate populations of P. strobiformis in warmer and wetter portions of its range growing in dense, shady forest stands, because larger seeds provide greater resources to germinants at the time of germination. Our models provide accurate predictions of morphological traits and important insights regarding the factors that contribute to their expression. Our results indicate that managers should be conservative during reforestation efforts to ensure match between ecotypic variation in seed source populations. However, we also note that given projected large range shift due to climate change, managers will have to balance the match between current ecotypic variation and expected range shift and changes in local adaptive optima under future climate conditions. © Copyright © 2020 Leal-Sáenz, Waring, Menon, Cushman, Eckert, Flores-Rentería, Hernández-Díaz, López-Sánchez, Martínez-Guerrero and Wehenkel.

AB  - Mapping of tree seedlings is useful for tasks ranging from monitoring natural succession and regeneration to effective silvicultural management. Development of methods that are both accurate and cost-effective is especially important considering the dramatic increase in tree planting that is required globally to mitigate the impacts of climate change. The combination of high-resolution imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles and object detection by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is one promising approach. However, unbiased assessments of these models and methods to integrate them into geospatial workflows are lacking. In this study, we present a method for rapid, large-scale mapping of young conifer seedlings using CNNs applied to RGB orthomosaic imagery. Importantly, we provide an unbiased assessment of model performance by using two well-characterised trial sites together containing over 30,000 seedlings to assemble datasets with a high level of completeness. Our results showed CNN-based models trained on two sites detected seedlings with sensitivities of 99.5% and 98.8%. False positives due to tall weeds at one site and naturally regenerating seedlings of the same species led to slightly lower precision of 98.5% and 96.7%. A model trained on examples from both sites had 99.4% sensitivity and precision of 97%, showing applicability across sites. Additional testing showed that the CNN model was able to detect 68.7% of obscured seedlings missed during the initial annotation of the imagery but present in the field data. Finally, we demonstrate the potential to use a form of weakly supervised training and a tile-based processing chain to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of CNNs applied to large, high-resolution orthomosaics. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

AB  - The oomycete plant pathogen, Phytophthora austrocedri, is an aggressive killer of cypress trees causing severe mortality of Chilean cedar (Austrocedrus chilensis) in Argentina since the 1940 s and now of common juniper (Juniperus communis s.l.) in the UK. Rapid mortality of key UK juniper populations was first observed in the early 2000 s. The causal agent of mortality was confirmed as P. austrocedri in 2012 and the pathogen has now been widely detected - but is not ubiquitous - in juniper populations across Scotland and England. Although juniper has a broad distribution across the northern hemisphere, the UK incidence of P. austrocedri remains the only confirmed infection of juniper populations globally. Juniper is an important species for biodiversity, so it is imperative to understand the abiotic and biotic drivers of emergent P. austrocedri infection to inform detection, containment and conservation strategies to manage juniper populations across the full extent of its range. As management of UK juniper populations is primarily conducted at a local level, we investigated field scale drivers of disease – in three, geographically separate populations with different infection histories. Variation in the proportion of juniper showing symptoms - discoloured or dead foliage – was measured using stratified sampling across along key environmental gradients within each 100-hectare population. Potential predictors of infection included altitude, slope, distance to nearest watercourse, soil moisture (mean percentage volumetric water content), area of red deer browsing damage and area of commonly associated vascular plant species. We assessed support in the data for alternative models explaining the spatial distribution of P. austrocedri symptoms using full subset covariate selection and Deviance Information Criteria (DIC). Despite differences in environmental gradients and infection histories between populations, area of juniper symptomatic for P. austrocedri increased with waterlogging, increasing with soil moisture in sites where soils had higher peat or clay contents, and decreasing with proximity to watercourses where sites had shallower, sandier soils. Furthermore, we identified common taxa in the associated plant community that correlated with increased area of symptoms and could be used by land managers as indicators to identify microsites at high risk of infection, enabling site-specific tailoring of disease management strategies. Such strategies could include prioritising detection inspections in microsites with high water tables and high grazing pressure (guided by indicator taxa), limiting soil disturbance in wet microsites and creating sites for natural regeneration in drier microsites, to minimise pathogen spread and maximise the resilience of existing juniper populations. © 2020

AB  - We examined the effects of two recent, high-severity disturbances on seed dispersal and conifer seedling establishment in a subalpine spruce-fir forest in the San Juan Mountains, Colorado. Our study area had undergone high forest mortality from a spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) outbreak beginning ca. 2004, and a portion of the study area was additionally burned by the West Fork Complex wildfire in 2013. The aim of this study was to determine how seedling re-establishment patterns vary with seed availability, temperature, overstory composition, and understory cover across a topographically heterogeneous landscape with varying disturbance impacts. We established thirty study sites in the burned area and sixty sites in the unburned, beetle-affected area in order to capture a gradient of beetle outbreak severity. We assessed post-disturbance regeneration by conducting seedling counts in the summer of 2018, five years after the fire and more than a decade since the onset of the beetle outbreak. We determined seedling establishment after disturbances by using terminal bud scar counts to estimate seedling age. We measured Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) seed dispersal and below-canopy temperatures over three years (2017–2019) using in situ seed traps and Logtag® temperature sensors at 2 m height. We assessed relationships between (1) seed availability and live overstory remaining after the spruce beetle outbreak, and (2) seedling abundance and all explanatory variables using hierarchical Bayesian models. Conifer seed and seedling counts were zero in most of the burned area, though there was abundant aspen regeneration at lower elevations. In unburned, beetle-affected forests, we found that the degree of spruce overstory mortality did not strongly affect seed availability but showed a strong effect on spruce seedling densities. Conifer seedling densities were also influenced by below-canopy temperatures, aspect, and understory litter and shrub cover. These results indicate that the West Fork Complex fire has potentially resulted in a long-term loss of conifer forest throughout much of the burn area where distance to a seed source is >100 m. High-severity spruce beetle outbreaks have also limited regeneration, although seedlings are still present in the majority of beetle-killed sites. Future patterns of re-establishment will also be strongly influenced by topography and future warming trends. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV) was home to about ten million hectare bottomland hardwood (BLH) forests in the Southern U.S. It experienced over 80 % area loss of the BLH forests in the past centuries and large-scale afforestation in recent decades. Due to the lack of a high-resolution cropland dataset, impacts of land use change (LUC) on the LMAV ecosystem services have not been fully understood. In this study, we developed a novel framework by integrating the machine learning algorithm, county-level agricultural census, and satellite-based cropland products to reconstruct the LMAV cropland distribution during 1850–2018 at a 30-m resolution. Results showed that the LMAV cropland area increased from 0.78 × 104 km2 in 1850 to 6.64 × 104 km2 in 1980 and then decreased to 6.16 × 104 km2 in 2018. Cropland expansion rate was the largest in the 1960s (749 km2 yr−1) but decreased rapidly thereafter, whereas cropland abandonment rate increased substantially in recent decades with the largest rate of 514 km2 yr−1 in the 2010s. Our dataset has three notable features: (1) the depiction of fine spatial details, (2) the integration of the county-level census, and (3) the inclusion of a machine-learning algorithm trained by satellite-based land cover product. Most importantly, our dataset well captured the continuous increasing trend in cropland area from 1930–1960, which was misrepresented by other cropland datasets reconstructed from the state-level census. Our dataset would be important to accurately evaluate the impacts of historical deforestation and recent afforestation efforts on regional ecosystem services, attribute the observed hydrological changes to anthropogenic and natural driving factors, and investigate how the socioeconomic factors control regional LUC pattern. Our framework and dataset are crucial to developing managerial and policy strategies for conserving natural resources and enhancing ecosystem services in the LMAV. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Exotic species are known to become invasive in several ecosystems, including areas undergoing restoration. But does that always happen? We monitored the tree layer, seed rain, and regenerating layer of 10-year and 20-year-old forests under restoration in southeast Brazil to verify if planted exotic trees were behaving as invasive; if they were influencing the species richness and abundance of regenerating native plants; and the probabilities of exotic trees perpetuating over time. Data from the three forest components (trees, seed rain, and regenerating) were collected in 12 permanent plots of 100 m2 each in each study area. Collected data were analyzed through generalized linear models (GLM) and Markov chains. We verified that exotic species were not behaving as invasive species. Of the five species planted, Acacia mangium, Syzygium cumini, and Psidium guajava were dispersing seeds but recruiting only six new individuals. In general, the species richness and abundance of exotic trees were not related to the richness and abundance of regenerating native plants. In addition, the chances of individuals’ transition between forest components were in most cases nil, so that exotic species should continue not to spread in the 10- and 20-year-old forests. We assume that biotic resistance was occurring in the assembled communities and this prevented exotic trees from behaving as invaders. Monitoring of forest components helped to better understand the role of non-native species in the dynamics of these novel ecosystems. Monitoring also indicated that not all recovering forests need management actions against exotic trees after a decade or two of restoration. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Land degradation and regeneration are complex processes that greatly impact climate regulation, ecosystem service provision, and population well-being and require an urgent and appropriate response through land use planning and interventions. Spatially explicit land change models can greatly help decision makers, but traditional regression approaches fail to capture the nonlinearity and complex interactions of the underlying drivers. Our objective was to use a machine learning algorithm combined with high-resolution data sets to provide simultaneous and spatial forecasts of deforestation, land degradation, and regeneration for the next two decades. A 17,000-km2 region in the south of Madagascar was taken as the study area. First, an empirical analysis of drivers of change was conducted, and then, an ensemble model was calibrated to predict and map potential changes based on 12 potential explanatory variables. These potential change maps were used to draw three scenarios of land change while considering past trends in intensity of change and expert knowledge. Historical observations displayed clear patterns of land degradation and relatively low regeneration. Amongst the 12 potential explanatory variables, distance to forest edge and elevation were the most important for the three land transitions studied. Random forest showed slightly better prediction ability compared with maximum entropy and generalized linear model. Business-as-usual scenarios highlighted the large areas under deforestation and degradation threat, and an alternative scenario enabled the location of suitable areas for regeneration. The approach developed herein and the spatial outputs provided can help stakeholders target their interventions or develop large-scale sustainable land management strategies. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Facial recognition based on visible-light RGB image is a mature technique. With the continuous progress of civilization, the protection against personal privacy and the effectiveness of the system is more stringent. In the past research, the distance from facial features was used as the de-identified biological feature, but this could not solve the problem of using a photo to deceive the system. Therefore, we used thermal image to convert into features by using the proposed feature extraction method, and uses deep learning, random forest, and ensemble learning to build a face prediction model. The proposed feature extraction method cuts the facial image (RGB and thermal image) into 12 and 48 blocks respectively as well as regenerates the feature image and the feature matrix. Based on the experimental results, accuracy of RGB image only with 0.834, feature image with 0.953, and feature matrix with 0.967. The feature images and feature matrices produced by the proposed feature extraction method can achieve better prediction performance. High accuracy of thermal imaging can solve the problem of fake photos and the issue of personal privacy de-identification could be solved. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Species ecological envelope maps were obtained for the two main Portuguese wood-production species (Eucalyptus globulus Labill. and Pinus pinaster Aiton) and projected future climate change scenarios. A machine learning approach was used to understand the most influential environmental variables that may explain current species distribution and productivity. Background and Objectives: The aims of the study were: (1) to map species potential suitability areas using ecological envelopes in the present and to project them in the future under climate change scenarios; (2) to map species current distributions; (3) to map species current productivity; and (4) to explore the most influential environmental variables on species current distribution and productivity. Materials and Methods: Climate, elevation data, and soil data sets were used to obtain present and future species ecological envelopes under two climate change scenarios. The official land cover maps were used to map species distributions. Forest inventory data were used to map the species productivity by geostatistical techniques. A Bayesian machine learning approach, supported by species distributions and productivity data, was used to explore the most influential environmental variables on species distribution and productivity and to validate species ecological envelopes. Results: The species ecological envelope methodology was found to be robust. Species' ecological envelopes showed a high potential for both species' afforestation. In the future, a decrease in the country's area potentiality was forecasted for both species. The distribution of maritime pine was found to be mainly determined by precipitation-related variables, but the elevation and temperature-related variables were very important to differentiate species productivity. For eucalypts, species distribution was mainly explained by temperature-related variables, as well as the species productivity. Conclusions: These findings are key to support recommendations for future afforestation and will bring value to policy-makers and environmental authorities in policy formulation under climate change scenarios. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Reversing deforestation is a pressing challenge for planetary health and global development, but the path to restoring forests on a globally significant scale is ill-defined, and government implementation of afforestation projects often generates conflict with user groups. Understanding the needs and values of forest-reliant stakeholders in developing countries and effectively engaging them in forest landscape restoration planning and implementation are critical steps towards meeting afforestation goals, and yet few examples of practical methods to include the poor in participatory environmental governance processes exist. Inspired by an approach used to mediate other natural resource conflicts, I structured a series of stakeholder focus groups in the Zomba–Machinga region of southern Malawi around Systems Thinking and Bayesian Belief Networks. Through these focus groups, I engaged forest-reliant households, academics and government staff in a participatory process to explore the conditions of past restoration failure; identify the barriers to future reforestation success; and develop proposed solutions. Out of eight focus groups held, seven viewed poverty as the single greatest obstacle to afforestation success, and all seven perceived small business capacity building as one of the three most important factors in poverty alleviation, followed in order of frequency by improved agricultural practices (six of seven groups), and non-forest employment (three of seven groups). If each focus group could successfully implement the three factors they considered most important, the groups' perceptions that poverty could be alleviated ranged from a likelihood of 15.8%–62.3%, with differences among focus groups that underscored inequities in social agency and vocational opportunities of the participants based on age and gender. This study illustrates where these diverse groups of stakeholders from a single region converge and diverge in their thinking, underscoring the importance of establishing durable participatory processes to work through conflicts, nurture trust and collaboratively develop solutions that are relevant to local conditions in order for global forest landscape restoration to succeed.

AB  - This article defines the land cover classes used in Meter-Scale Urban Land Cover (MULC), a unique, high resolution (one meter2 per pixel) land cover dataset developed for 30 US communities for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) EnviroAtlas. MULC data categorize the landscape into these land cover classes: impervious surface, tree, grass-herbaceous, shrub, soil-barren, water, wetland and agriculture. MULC data are used to calculate approximately 100 EnviroAtlas metrics that serve as indicators of nature's benefits (ecosystem goods and services). MULC, a dataset for which development is ongoing, is produced by multiple classification methods using aerial photo and LiDAR datasets. The mean overall fuzzy accuracy across the EnviroAtlas communities is 88% and mean Kappa coefficient is 0.84. MULC is available in EnviroAtlas via web browser, web map service (WMS) in the user's geographic information system (GIS), and as downloadable data at EPA Environmental Data Gateway. Fact sheets and metadata for each MULC community are available through EnviroAtlas. Some MULC applications include mapping green and grey infrastructure, connecting land cover with socioeconomic/demographic variables, street tree planting, urban heat island analysis, mosquito habitat risk mapping and bikeway planning. This article provides practical guidance for using MULC effectively and developing similar high resolution (HR) land cover data. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Information and material biological legacies that persist after catastrophic forest disturbance collectively constitute the ecological memory of the system and may strongly influence future stand development. Catastrophic disturbances often result in an influx of coarse woody debris (CWD), and this material legacy may provide beneficial microsites that affect successional and structural developmental pathways. We examined how microenvironmental characteristics influence the regeneration of woody plants in a subtropical woodland that experienced a large influx of CWD from a catastrophic wind disturbance. Specifically, we asked (1) what microenvironmental factors best explain woody plant density, richness, and height in the regeneration layer and (2) does woody plant density, richness, and height benefit from the large influx of CWD to a degree that competition dynamics and succession may be modified? Data were collected in a Pinus palustris woodland that had experienced an EF3 tornado and was subjected to a four-year prescribed fire rotation. We documented live woody plants <5 cm diameter at breast height, soil, and site characteristics and tested for differences in seedling and sapling density, species richness, and height in relation to CWD proximity. We used a random forest machine learning algorithm to examine the influence of microenvironmental conditions on the characteristics of woody plants in the regeneration layer. Woody plant density and species richness were not significantly different by proximity to CWD, but plants near CWD were slightly taller than plants away from CWD. The best predictors of woody plant density, richness, and height were abiotic site characteristics including slope gradient and azimuth, organic matter depth and weight, and soil water content. Results indicated that the regeneration of woody plants in this P. palustris woodland was not strongly influenced by the influx of CWD, but by other biological legacies such as existing root networks and soil characteristics. Our study highlights the need to consider ecological memory in forest management decision-making after catastrophic disturbance. Information and material legacies shape recovery patterns, but, depending on the system, some legacies will be more influential on successional and developmental pathways than others. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Rauli (Nothofagus alpina (Poepp. & Endl.) and Ulmo (Eucryphia cordifolia Cav.) are mid-tolerant tree species in the Coihue-Rauli-Tepa (ca. 0.55 mill ha) and Evergreen (ca. 4.1 mill ha) forest types in south-central Chile, respectively. These species have been selectively logged in old-growth forests especially during the 20th century, Rauli mostly for its highly valuable timber, and Ulmo for its highly demanded firewood and bark for the tannery industry. Natural regeneration of these species occurs mostly through canopy gaps, but it can be retarded, or even inhibited, when the cover of the understory vegetation becomes unusually dense, such as in high-graded forests. Although underplanting is possible for these species, the knowledge about their growth in forest understories is scarce, and necessary to inform restoration programs. Therefore, we evaluated short-term responses (two years) of underplanted containerized seedlings in root-collar diameter, height, stem volume, and in the slenderness index, as a function of canopy openness (%, continuous variable) and three restoration treatments (categorical variables, plus one control treatment) at two different sites with high-graded old-growth forests for each forest type. By using generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) we determined that Rauli was more sensitive to the influence of both canopy openness and restoration treatments, while Ulmo was mostly influenced by canopy openness. Specifically, Rauli was positively influenced by canopy openness and restoration treatments in all response variables except for the slenderness index. Conversely, Ulmo was influenced by canopy openness in all response variables except the slenderness index, which was influenced by both predictor variables (canopy openness and restoration treatments). Thus, prospects for restoration with these species are discussed, including possible ontogenetic changes in their responses to light that may demand continuous silvicultural operations to recover the productive and functional roles of these species in these forest ecosystems. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Questions: In terms of biodiversity conservation, forest plantations are often considered problematic because they usually have negative effects on natural ecosystems. Soil seed banks could play an important role in restoring vegetation that was originally present, by recruiting species that have disappeared above-ground. We addressed this topic in plantations located in the Patagonian steppe by asking the following questions: Are richness, abundance and composition of steppe above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank affected by plantations? Is species composition of the above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank similar in plantations and in the steppe?. Location: NW of Chubut Province, Patagonia, Argentina. Methods: We selected three plantations located in the steppe, and delimited three sectors: steppe, plantation edge and plantation interior. We compared richness and abundance by species origin and growth form among sectors for the above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank compartments, using generalized linear mixed models. We compared species composition for each compartment and between them using permutational multivariate analysis of variance and non-metric multidimensional scaling. Results: In above-ground vegetation, we found a decrease in richness and abundance, and changes in composition from the steppe to the plantation interior. Richness and abundance of the soil seed bank did not show differences among steppe and the plantation sectors, although composition was different among them. Above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank species composition were always different; native perennial herbs and shrubs were predominant in the above-ground vegetation while exotic annual herbs dominated the soil seed bank. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that plant recruitment from the soil seed bank would not be sufficient for restoring depleted species pools in the above-ground vegetation of plantations. Therefore, actions promoting native species reestablishment and control of exotics should be considered to reach the aim of restoring biodiversity in former plantations. © 2020 International Association for Vegetation Science

AB  - Land degradation with water-logging and salinity is global problem especially in arid and semiarid regions. As an alternative for capital-intensive engineering approaches, plantation forestry has been advocated as an eco-friendly option to offset hydrological imbalances (bio–drainage) mainly for dryland salinity conditions. With robust monitoring world over, reforestation mainly with fast growing versatile Eucalyptus species have emerged as the most water profligate. These lower the water–table by extracting soil water throughout the year and even from deeper soil and phreatic zones. The annual evapo-transpiration of plantations vary from about 0.2 to 0.8 times OPE (Open Pan Evaporation) under dryland conditions and can equal or even exceed OPE under irrigated conditions. The factors like soil and climatic conditions, groundwater depth and its quality, growth rates of tree species; their stocking, patterns and the geometries and fraction of area under plantations define their effectiveness for water table draw-down and salinity control. Nevertheless, the emerging arguments against bio–management include long time–lag, high land requirements and decline in their efficiency with salinity build-up underneath plantations. To overcome these constraints, shifting plantations in between discharge and recharge areas, reforestation with salt-tolerant species, integrating these with cropping systems and even with engineering measures in saline discharge areas are the alternate options. The gainful employment of bio-drainage demands the diagnosis of typical areas to be reforested in catchments using GIS/remote sensing tools, the development of decision support systems (DSS) for appropriate designing of reforestation strategies and their amalgamation with existing farming systems. Benefits of plantations beyond on-and off-site salinity control should aim at enhanced farm incomes, restoring biodiversity and particularly carbon trading when global interests are now targeting climate mitigation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Predicting forest succession is not a trivial pursuit and has remained a central challenge for scientists and foresters for well over a century. While thousands of papers have been published on the topic, contributing to a plethora of concepts and terminologies, there remains confusion over causal mechanisms, inhibiting our ability to adopt many lessons learned to sustainable forest management. Based on an emerging conceptual model of forest succession, presented here as the “Succession Triangle”, we sought to explore the relative importance of mechanisms hypothesized to drive succession following commercial harvesting across a wide landscape in the Acadian Forest Region of eastern Canada. Using machine learning techniques and repeatedly measured forest stand inventory data, including 19,332 forest stands measured over a ≈30 year period, we uncovered dominant early succession pathways and investigated key mechanisms driving these pathways. Overall, our results show stands may follow multiple succession pathways following harvesting, including early dominance by so-called “late-succession” species (e.g., black spruce and sugar maple), depending on causal mechanisms. More specifically, mechanisms related to the state of the environment (primarily climate) and differential species availability (mainly pre- and post-harvest overstorey composition) had the strongest control over early succession. The strong influence of pre-harvest composition on early succession supports the ‘direct regeneration’ hypothesis; while the importance of post-harvest overstorey composition suggests the use of partial-cutting as a means of regenerating shade-tolerant species (e.g., sugar maple and red spruce). Site conditions (i.e., slope and drainage) influenced the direction of succession, but landscape-level variation in climate had the overall strongest effect, with colder, more moist climates promoting regeneration of balsam fir, while warmer, dryer climates encouraged shade-intolerant, broadleaf species (birches, red maple and poplars), especially following clear-cutting. Given the strong influence of climate, we used our fitted model to predict the impact of late 21st century climate change on early succession using the “business-as-usual” RCP 8.5 radiative forcing scenario. Our results indicate climate change is likely to increase the regeneration of shade-intolerant, broadleaf tree species (e.g., red maple and poplars) across the landscape at the loss of cold-adapted balsam fir, supporting the hypothesis that young, post-harvest stands are vulnerable to climate-driven shifts in composition as postulated by ‘resilience theory’, and corroborating previous simulation studies that predict rapid 21st century climate warming will lead to ‘deborealization’ of Canada's Acadian Forest Region. © 2020

AB  - Primates worldwide are faced with increasing threats making them more vulnerable to extinction. Anthropogenic disturbances, such as habitat degradation and fragmentation, are among the main concerns, and in Madagascar, these issues have become widespread. As this situation continues to worsen, we sought to understand how fragmentation affects primate distribution throughout the island. Further, because species may exhibit different sensitivity to fragmentation, we also aimed to estimate the role of functional traits in mitigating their response. We collated data from 32 large-bodied lemur species ranges, consisting of species from the families Lemuridae (five genera) and Indriidae (two genera). We fitted Generalized Linear Models to determine the role of habitat fragmentation characteristics, for example, forest cover, patch size, edge density, and landscape configuration, as well as the protected area (PA) network, on the species relative probability of presence. We then assessed how the influence of functional traits (dietary guild, home range size) mitigate the response of species to these habitat metrics. Habitat area had a strong positive effect for many species, and there were significantly negative effects of fragmentation on the distribution of many lemur species. In addition, there was a positive influence of PAs on many lemur species’ distribution. Functional trait classifications showed that lemurs of all dietary guilds are negatively affected by fragmentation; however, folivore-frugivores show greater flexibility/variability in terms of habitat area and landscape complexity compared to nearly exclusive folivores and frugivores. Furthermore, species of all home range sizes showed a negative response to fragmentation, while habitat area had an increasingly positive effect as home range increased in size. Overall, the general trends for the majority of lemur species are dire and point to the need for immediate actions on a multitude of fronts, most importantly landscape-level reforestation efforts. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - It is important to grasp the number and location of trees, and measure tree structure attributes, such as tree trunk diameter and height. The accurate measurement of these parameters will lead to efficient forest resource utilization, maintenance of trees in urban cities, and feasible afforestation planning in the future. Recently, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has been receiving considerable attention, compared with conventional manual measurement techniques. However, it is difficult to use LiDAR for widespread applications, mainly because of the costs. We propose a method for tree measurement using 360 spherical cameras, which takes omnidirectional images. For the structural measurement, the three-dimensional (3D) images were reconstructed using a photogrammetric approach called structure from motion. Moreover, an automatic tree detection method from the 3D images was presented. First, the trees included in the 360 spherical images were detected using YOLO v2. Then, these trees were detected with the tree information obtained from the 3D images reconstructed using structure from motion algorithm. As a result, the trunk diameter and height could be accurately estimated from the 3D images. The tree detection model had an F-measure value of 0.94. This method could automatically estimate some of the structural parameters of trees and contribute to more efficient tree measurement. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation in forest fragments surrounded by a low-quality matrix requires an understanding of how ecological conditions prevailing in the matrix enter the fragments and interact with local habitat conditions. We assessed the regeneration of oak species along edge-interior gradients in forest fragments at the periphery of Mexico City. The abundance of oak saplings was sampled along transects to the forest, while the edge effect was analysed using segmented zero-inflated Poisson models for abundance data. Three oak species were dominant in terms of their relative abundances: Quercus laeta, Quercus castanea and Quercus obtusata. Regeneration of nine oak species responded nonlinearly to the edge distance, with greater sapling abundance from the edge up to 10 m into the fragment. Canopy cover and tree height decreased from edge to fragment interior, while saplings increased in open areas within the fragments (i.e., independent of edge distance). A posterior analysis indicated that Q. obtusata reacted positively to edges. These results indicate that oak regeneration is promoted by suitable habitat conditions near the boundaries. Therefore, we suggest that forest management should focus on promoting seed production and oak establishment in forest interior habitats. © Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2019.

AB  - Shorea platyclados (Dark Red Meranti) is a commercially important timber tree species in Southeast Asia. However, its stocks have dramatically declined due, inter alia, to excessive logging, insufficient natural regeneration and a slow recovery rate. Thus, there is a need to promote enrichment planting and develop effective technique to support its rehabilitation and improve timber production through implementation of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Genomic Selection (GS). To assist such efforts, plant materials were collected from a half-sib progeny population in Sari Bumi Kusuma forest concession, Kalimantan, Indonesia. Using 5900 markers in sequences obtained from 356 individuals, we detected high linkage disequilibrium (LD) extending up to >145 kb, suggesting that associations between phenotypic traits and markers in LD can be more easily and feasibly detected with GWAS than with analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTLs). However, the detection power of GWAS seems low, since few single nucleotide polymorphisms linked to any focal traits were detected with a stringent false discovery rate, indicating that the species' phenotypic traits are mostly under polygenic quantitative control. Furthermore, Machine Learning provided higher prediction accuracies than Bayesian methods. We also found that stem diameter, branch diameter ratio and wood density were more predictable than height, clear bole, branch angle and wood stiffness traits. Our study suggests that GS has potential for improving the productivity and quality of S. platyclados, and our genomic heritability estimates may improve the selection of traits to target in future breeding of this species. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Given the impact of tropical forest disturbances on atmospheric carbon emissions, biodiversity, and ecosystem productivity, accurate long-term reporting of Land-Use and Land-Cover (LULC) change in the pre-satellite era (<1972) is an imperative. Here, we used a combination of historical (1958) aerial photography and contemporary remote sensing data to map long-term changes in the extent and structure of the tropical forest surrounding Yangambi (DR Congo) in the central Congo Basin. Our study leveraged structure-from-motion and a convolutional neural network-based LULC classifier, using synthetic landscape-based image augmentation to map historical forest cover across a large orthomosaic (~93,431 ha) geo-referenced to ~4.7 ± 4.3 m at submeter resolution. A comparison with contemporary LULC data showed a shift from previously highly regular industrial deforestation of large areas to discrete smallholder farming clearing, increasing landscape fragmentation and providing opportunties for substantial forest regrowth. We estimated aboveground carbon gains through reforestation to range from 811 to 1592 Gg C, partially offsetting historical deforestation (2416 Gg C), in our study area. Efforts to quantify long-term canopy texture changes and their link to aboveground carbon had limited to no success. Our analysis provides methods and insights into key spatial and temporal patterns of deforestation and reforestation at a multi-decadal scale, providing a historical context for past and ongoing forest research in the area. © 2020 by the author.

AB  - Conversion of agricultural lands to forest plantations to mitigate rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has been proposed, but it depends on accurate estimation of the on-site carbon (C) stocks distribution. The use of aerial laser scanning (ALS) data is a rapidly evolving technology for the quantification of C stocks. We evaluated the use of allometric models together with high-density ALS data for the quantification of biomass and soil C stocks in a 14-year-old Quercus ilex and Q. suber plantation in Southwestern Spain. In 2010, a field survey was performed and tree dasometric and biomass variables were measured. Forty-five soil profiles (N = 180 soil samples) were taken systematically and the soil organic C content (SOC) was determined. Biomass and soil organic C values were regressed against individual dasometric variables and total tree height was used as a predictor variable. Aerial laser scanning data were acquired with a point density of 12 points m−2. Relationships among ALS metrics and tree height were determined using stepwise regression models and used in the allometric models to estimate biomass and SOC C stocks. Finally, a C stock map of the holm-cork oak cover in the study area was generated. We found a tree total biomass of 27.9 kg tree−1 for holm oak and 41.1 kg tree−1 for cork oak. In the holm oak plantation, the SOC content was 36.90 Mg ha−1 for the layer 0–40 cm (SOC40) under the tree crown and 29.26 Mg ha−1 for the inter-planted area, with significant differences from the reference agricultural land (33.35 Mg ha−1). Linear regression models were developed to predict the biomass and SOC at the tree scale, based on tree height (R2 &gt;0.72 for biomass, and R2 &gt;0.62 for SOC). The overall on-site C stock in the holm-cork oak plantation was 35.11 Mg ha−1, representing a net C stock rise of 0.47 Mg ha−1 yr−1. The ALS data allows a reliable estimation of C stocks in holm and cork oak plantations and high-resolution maps of on-site C stocks are useful for silvicultural planning. The cost of ALS data acquisition has decreased and this method can be generalised to plantations of other Mediterranean species established on agricultural lands at regional scales. However, an increase of filed data and the availability of local biomass and, in particular, SOC will improve accurate quantification of the C stocks from allometric equations, and extrapolation to large planted areas. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Exploring high-performing adsorption-driven heat pumps (AHPs) remains a challenging task owing to the low working capacity, high regeneration temperature, and low energy efficiency of conventional adsorbents. Quick discovery of the novel promising adsorbents could help to improve the coefficient of performance of AHPs for heating (COPH) and cooling (COPC). Herein, we reported an approach to identify the high-performing covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) for heating, cooling, and ice making by high-throughput computational screening based on grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations and, for the first time, machine learning. It was demonstrated that compared with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), COFs were more suitable adsorbents of AHPs for cooling because of their weak interaction toward ethanol that favors stepwise adsorption. Structure-property relationship analysis revealed that the average enthalpy of adsorption commensurate with the enthalpy of evaporation will benefit the performance of AHPs besides the high working capacity and low step positions of adsorption isotherms. In order to reduce the computational cost of screening, a random forest model was developed to successfully predict the COPC of both COFs and MOFs. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Deforestation in North Korea has been covered in many studies, but the exact amount of its impact and geographical area is still very different depending on the research and literature. In this study, we used Sentinel-2, the latest multi-spectral satellite image in Europe, and Landsat satellite image, which can detect forest cover before deforestation, to find out where to restore not only the degraded area. Forest area was identified in 1970-1980s using Landsat satellite images and focused on changes in the area. Monthly Sentinel-2 images are calculated as NDVI to identify forest-related covers through phenological change of vegetation. Random forest machine learning classification is used to classify each cover. And for the impact of deforestation also quantified in terms of agriculture and water by multi-spatial model. Agro-environmental variables, agricultural water demand and forest water supply were estimated using the EPIC and InVEST-WY models, respectively. Analysis of deforestation showed that area under forests decreased by 25%, whereas that under cropland increased by 63%, and that the conversion from forest to cropland was the largest for the study period. As a result, agricultural water demand increased and forest water supply decreased, significantly. Analysis of the net impact of deforestation on water budgets using recent climate and two land covers showed that forest water supply decreased by 43% and agricultural water demand increased by 62%. In terms of agro-environment, the negative changes in organic carbon loss, water erosion, and runoff were observed, regardless of the crop type. On newly-converted agricultural lands, runoff is 1.5 times higher and water-driven erosion and soil organic loss are more than twice as high compared to older croplands. The North Korea has declined many benefits from ecosystem attributable to deforestation in recent three decades. In contrast, South Korea has experienced success in national-scale afforestation in recent decades, and North Korea can emulate this. The restoration of forests in North Korea promises more than environmental benefits; it will provide a new growth engine for the prosperity of the Korean Peninsula as a whole. © 2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: "Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future".

AB  - In forest restoration projects, assessing progress is critically important. This study was conducted to quantify the restoration progress for approximately 30 year old plantation plots of Acacia and Pterocarpus in Sakaerat, Thailand. For 22.5 × 22.5 m areas in the plantation plots, as a continuous measure of forest restoration, dry evergreen forest-likelihood was determined using 45 cm resolution satellite images and an artificial neural network architecture. The Acacia plot achieved a moderate mean evergreen forest likelihood of 0.451 (April 2016) to 0.679 (May 2019), but the values for the Pterocarpus plot were 0.076 or smaller. Two other Pterocarpus plots at cooler and moister sites had mean evergreen forest-likelihood values of up to 0.884 (April 2016), which were significantly greater than that (0.451) for the Acacia plot, but the values dropped in May 2019. Throughout the period of the four image acquisition times from March 2014 to May 2019, the plantation plots had significantly smaller evergreen forest-likelihood than the dry evergreen forest did. The current approach would be a helpful option for stakeholders of forest management by applying sub-m-resolution images and machine learning followed by quantification of the forest restoration effects relying on the appearance and texture of tree canopies at multiple data acquisition times. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - In Ecuador, the changes in vegetation coverage seem to be directly influenced by the deforestation rates, and by the change in use of soil with forestation capabilities to farming soils, causing the loss of native forests, as well as the goods and services they help provide to the local communities. The objective of this article is to get a preliminary diagnostic of the management of the Forest and Protecting Vegetation Areas (ABVP) in the towns of the province of Azuay, through the reviewof: Development and Territorial Management Plans (PDYOT) available in the city level governments; statistics of town areas as given by the Ecuadorian National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC), Maps of ABVP's emitted by the Ministry of Environment, and the Department of National Forests, which are available at the National Department of Information (SNI). Getting to the conclusion that more than 60% of the ABVP in the entire province are centralized in the cities of Cuenca (42%) and Pucara (19%), and also existing in a town which has not reported the existence of ABVP called Guachalapa; The most frequent anthropogenic activity in the towns that pushes the ABVP's is the expansion of the farming areas (8 towns), followed by the cattle farming activities (6 towns); the reforestation is one of the most frequently proposed projects to achieve the recovery and conservation of the ABVPs, followed by updating activities for the ABVP Forest Management Plans. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - For Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) network, although there exist many studies that focus on improving the performance with relays, security issues are often neglected. Due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, relay nodes in LTE-A network may act maliciously, affect communication, reduce quality, and cause delays. Recently, physical (PHY) layer security has attracted researchers to provide secure communication and data privacy. In this study, we propose using unsupervised learning approach at the destination node to detect malicious relay attacks in cooperative LTE-A network based on received source signal in the PHY layer. Outlier detection algorithms such as one class support vector machine (OCSVM), local outlier factor (LOF) and isolation forest ( i Forest) are applied to detect various malicious relay behaviors such as garbling, regenerative, and false data injection type attacks. As input to these algorithms, feature vectors are constructed by using amplitude, phase, and relative phase information of modulated baseband symbols. The performance of the outlier detectors are evaluated with respect to precision, accuracy, and under the area curve (AUC) measures under changing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels, different modulation types, allocated number of resource blocks (RBs), and varying data size. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed outlier detection approach for detecting malicious relays in the LTE-A network. Accuracy and precision of the algorithms are observed to be above 90% for 10 dB and larger SNR levels for the relay attack scenarios considered here. AUC values for all algorithms for all SNR levels is also above 0.9 for the attack detection cases, and the performance of the LOF algorithm with 0.95 and above AUC values is superior to other algorithms. The results verify the contribution of this study, which is the demonstration of the effectiveness of one class outlier detection approaches for detecting malicious relays in the LTE-A network. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - As of 2018 the area covered by the forests was determined to be 30.6% of the world’s land surface which is roughly below 3.8 billion hectares. With the exponential increase in population, the pressure on the natural resources increases which results in cutting the trees for agriculture and for industrial purposes thereby leading to deforestation. In this paper, we investigate the spatial distribution of vegetation cover by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and satellite images. The features of the object identified by the CNN is extremely complex because of the number of filters used to identify various patterns. Supervised learning (learning with annotated data) is used to train the CNN model as it results in better accuracy while determining the forest cover. We leverage this technology of instance segmentation to correctly determine the forest cover in a particular satellite image that radically improves the accuracy. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Mixed mountain forests composed of Picea abies, Abies alba and Fagus sylvatica represent one of the most important alpine ecosystems with respect to economics, environmental effects and social functions. However, many stands are characterised by even-aged forest structure and altered tree species composition, making them more prone to disturbances and less effective in protection against natural hazards. Changes to the forest microclimate and nutrient cycling delay natural regeneration and favour the successional development of ground vegetation. In this study we hypothesized that the creation of gaps of appropriate size and shape would facilitate natural regeneration and forest conversion. In 2003, we selected 15 gaps, ranging in size from 0.01 to 0.62 ha and more than 50 years in age, and three areas below closed canopy on a south facing P. abies dominated mixed mountain forest (1380–1480 m a.s.l.). Within the gaps we established 542 systematically distributed research plots (1.5 × 1.5 m) and analysed regeneration attributes according to height classes, ground vegetation coverage, light climate, topsoil moisture, microsite relief and soil features. Measurements were repeated after five vegetation seasons and indicated minimal changes in vegetation structure and the slow development of regeneration overall. Vegetation ordination and generalized linear mixed models showed a positive association of P. abies seedling abundance with diffuse light, thickness of the organic horizons, presence of CWD and moss coverage and a negative association with ground vegetation cover, soil water content, Landolt indication value for nutrients and direct light. Fagus sylvatica seedlings were more abundant closer to seed trees, on less acidic soils with higher moisture content and on concave microrelief. The results indicate that P. abies and F. sylvatica seedlings may successfully establish under slightly open forest canopies, but in a few years the former require amounts of diffuse light comparable with that in the medium sized gaps in this study (0.15 ha). Due to the negative association between direct light and regeneration, gaps should be elliptical with the long axis oriented east-west. Recruitment of all species was significantly retarded by overbrowsing. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The recovery of postindustrial ecosystems is difficult to predict and depends on numerous factors. Afforestation whereby trees are planted without improvement of soil properties is a popular means of landfill reclamation in Europe, to inhibit the effect of soil erosion. This slows down or completely prevents effective recolonization of many natural ecosystem components. The aim of the study was to test a method using the life-history traits of ground beetle assemblages as a predictor of the effectiveness of ecological restoration in afforested areas. The study was conducted on 45 sampling transects located in three ecosystem types: afforested landfills, landfills where spontaneous succession took place and reference forests. The following carabid life history traits were analysed: body size, dispersal power, food preferences, breeding type, and habitat preferences. In total, 2036 specimens belonging to 36 Carabidae species were collected. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to classify ground beetle assemblages according to ecosystem types (analysis of dissimilarity showed significant distance differences, p < .001). We noted shifts in life history traits towards early succession in assemblages of afforested areas. Generalized linear mixed models of afforested sites revealed significantly higher abundance of herbivorous, open-area species with medium body size, high dispersal power and a spring breeding cycle. In contrast, sites where spontaneous succession occured were dominated by carabids whose life history traits were similar to those of assemblages inhabiting the reference forests, i.e. medium body-sized predators with low dispersal power and an autumn breeding cycle. We conclude that an approach based on ground beetle life-history traits can be a useful tool indicating the direction and effectiveness of ecosystem recovery in post-industrial areas and can be used as a measurable criterion for assessment of restoration activities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Studies have shown that the construction industry is one of the biggest polluters on the planet, so environmental standards must be implemented to minimize its impact. The daily increase in housing is shortening the forests and areas once protected. Due to the increase in demand for housing in Guayaquil, the population has migrated to neighboring cantons acquiring villas in urbanizations. This increase in the real estate sector is not ecologically sustainable because harmful materials are used for the environment and health, in addition to the use of machinery that uses fossil fuel. The objective of this research is to determine what would be the new regulations of environmental management in the building systems for the buildings of “La Aurora” by reviewing the pollutants that throw the materials most used in construction in order to establish the margins of contamination allowed and the means to compensate for the damage created. To determine the new regulations, a scenario analysis combined with neutrosophical cognitive maps and the TOPSIS multicriteria method is used. This combination allows analyzing the main scenarios and ordering them according to the multiple dimensions of the problem. Among the proposals to mitigate environmental pollution are the use of less polluting materials in construction, clean energies in the illumination of homes and public spaces as well as the increase of green areas and reforestation programs per m2 of areas dedicated to develop. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Comparing with the classic redundancy policy of multi-replica technology, Erasure code is preferred due to its higher utilization rate of storage space in distributed storage system. As one kind of the important Erasure code, the traditional regeneration code with star recovery topology cost more time and more network bandwidth in the data recovery process. An efficient approach to reduce the delay time and network consumption is to construct an optimal recovery tree with the best possible bottleneck bandwidth, which is proved to be a Non-deterministic Polynomial problem. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a hybrid genetic algorithm which utilizes the designed crossover operation and mutation operation according to the problem property. A series of experiments have been conducted and the results show that our proposed method has good convergent ability and reduce the regeneration time. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - We compiled maps for the topsoil (0–30 cm) organic carbon (SOC) stock and its prediction uncertainty in Hungary at 100 m resolution for the years 1992 and 2010 using a machine learning algorithm, namely, quantile regression forest. 10-fold cross-validation was used for checking the accuracy of the spatial predictions and uncertainty quantifications for both years. The performance of the spatial predictions and uncertainty quantifications was appropriate, which was verified by the computed biases (0.15 and 0.30 for 1992 and 2010), root mean square errors (21.99 and 21.39 for 1992 and 2010), accuracy plots and the G statistics (0.96 for both years) as well. Based on the compiled SOC stock maps, we assessed the spatio-temporal change of SOC stocks on the territory of Hungary. A scheme was elaborated based on the quantified prediction uncertainties for identifying and delimiting significant and tendentious changes of SOC stock during the respective period. The total SOC stock in the topsoil was found to be 424.41 Tg (1 teragram = 1012 grams) in 1992 and 451.59 Tg in 2010. Thus SOC stock increased by 27.18 Tg over the respective period. On those areas where the land use types did not change, we observed that the SOC stock increased under forests (by 16.29 Tg) and pastures (by 2.48 Tg), decreased under wetlands (by 0.49 Tg) and did not change under agricultural areas. On those areas where the land use has been changed during the 18-year period, we found that afforestation has increased the SOC stock, whereas cultivation of pastures has decreased it. Due to soil sealing 34,000 ha of soil have been lost resulting in approximately 1.7 Tg carbon loss. We compared our own total SOC stock estimate and map referring to 1992 with other estimates and maps provided by global and continental initiatives. The comparisons have pointed out that the SOC stock map of 1992 outperformed these maps. We recommend applying the SOC stock map of 1992 as a baseline for Hungary. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Background: White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have increased during the past century in the USA. Greater deer densities may reduce tree regeneration, leading to forests that are understocked, where growing space is not filled completely by trees. Despite deer pressure, a major transition in eastern forests has resulted in increased tree densities. Methods: To reconcile conflicting trends, we applied generalized linear mixed models to compare deer densities during 1982 and then 1996 to tree stocking after about 30 years and 15 years of potential reductions of small trees by deer, for the entire eastern US and 11 ecological provinces. We also compiled deer browse preferences and compared preferred browse with trends in tree species composition from historical (1620–1900) and current tree surveys. Results: The forested area of the eastern US, including a prairie ecological province, was equally well-stocked (52%) and understocked (48%) during 2011–2017 tree surveys. For 1982 deer densities, 38% of area had deer densities &gt; 5.8 deer/km2 and for 1996, 66% of area had deer densities &gt; 5.8 deer/km2. Deer densities and tree stocking were not related significantly for the entire eastern US. Deer may reduce tree stocking in the Laurentian Mixed Forest; however, this province had both lower deer densities and greater tree stocking than other provinces. Furthermore, major tree species trends did not match tree browse preferences. Conclusions: Rather than too few trees, too many trees is an ecological problem where historical open oak and pine forests had herbaceous understories, and currently, trees have captured growing space. We attribute other drivers than deer to explain this transition. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to explore the relative importance of negative density dependence and habitat filtering on tree seedling survivalin community, age class and species, so as to provide theoretical basis for the mechanisms of seedling regeneration and species diversity maintenance in a temperate forest. Method: During 2016 to 2018, 209 seedling census stations were monitored in the secondary mixed conifer and broad-leaved forest plot in Jiaohe, Jilin Province, northeast China. We used generalized linear mixed models including zero, biotic, habitat, and full model to assess the relative importance of the habitat factors and biotic neighborhood variables on tree seedling survival at the levels of community, age classes and species. Result: From 2016 to 2018, a total of 3 970 tree seedlings belonged to 13 genera, 10 families and 19 species were recorded. In order of the important values, the top five seedling species were Fraxinus mandschurica, Tilia amurensis, Acer mono, Pinus koraiensis, and Acer mandshuricum. At the end of the census year, 2 644 seedlings had died, with a survival rate of 33.4%. At the community level, the survival of seedlings was significantly correlated with both biotic neighborhoods and habitat factors. Specifically, the survival of seedlings was positively correlated with the number of heterospecific seedling neighbors, the soil available potassium and total phosphorus(P< 0.05). The response of seedling survival to biotic neighborhoods and habitat factors varied among different age groups. The survival of annual seedlings was positively correlated with their conspecificand heterospecific seedling neighbors(P< 0.05, P< 0.01, respectively), but negatively correlated with heterospecific adult neighbors(P< 0.05). For perennial seedlings, however, there is no significant correlation between the seedling survival and the biotic neighborhoods. Nevertheless, we found a significant positive correlation between perennial seedling survival and habitat factors(P< 0.05), such as soil available potassium and total phosphorusty. Individual species-level analyses indicated that the optimal seedling survival models varied among species. We also found that the response of seedling survival to biotic neighborhoods and habitat factors varied widely among species. Specifically, the Fraxinus mandshurica seedlings survival was positively correlated with heterospecific seedling neighbors(P< 0.05). The survival of Acer mono seedlings was negatively correlated with conspecific adult neighbors(P< 0.05). Tilia amurensis had a higher survival rate in habitats with higher soil available potassium. Pinus koraiensis seedlings, however, preferred to soil with lower available nitrogen and phosphorus. Conclusion: We provided strong evidence that both density dependence and habitat filtering affect tree seedling survival and their relative importance varied with age classes and seedling species. The survival of annual seedlings was mainly affected by biotic neighbors, however the effect of habitat factors was more significant on the survival of perennial seedlings. Our result indicated that the effect of negative density dependence was verified in our forest plot. Among the habitat factors, soil nutrient had a significant effect on seedling survival. According to the differences of biotic neighborhood and habitat effects on seedling survival among species and age classes, corresponding forest managements are needed in seedling raising and replantation of the main tree species. © 2019, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

AB  - Monitoring tree regeneration in forest areas disturbed by resource extraction is a requirement for sustainably managing the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada. Small remotely piloted aircraft systems (sRPAS, a.k.a. drones) have the potential to decrease the cost of field surveys drastically, but produce large quantities of data that will require specialized processing techniques. In this study, we explored the possibility of using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on this data for automatically detecting conifer seedlings along recovering seismic lines: a common legacy footprint from oil and gas exploration. We assessed three different CNN architectures, of which faster region-CNN (R-CNN) performed best (mean average precision 81%). Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of training-set size, season, seedling size, and spatial resolution on the detection performance. Our results indicate that drone imagery analyzed by artificial intelligence can be used to detect conifer seedlings in regenerating sites with high accuracy, which increases with the size in pixels of the seedlings. By using a pre-trained network, the size of the training dataset can be reduced to a couple hundred seedlings without any significant loss of accuracy. Furthermore, we show that combining data from different seasons yields the best results. The proposed method is a first step towards automated monitoring of forest restoration/regeneration. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Humans have widely extirpated large carnivores and simultaneously promoted overabundance of deer. The intense pressure imposed by these herbivores in forests has led to extremely low rates of natural forest regeneration. In natural old-growth forests, deadwood functions as a key driver of biodiversity and promotes ecosystem functioning, such as water retention and nutrient recycling. An as yet unappreciated function of deadwood is its ability to act as a physical barrier, excluding large herbivores from the obstructed patches and thereby reducing browsing pressure. However, this benefit may be minimized by an increase in rodent herbivory in the sheltered patches. In this study, a field experiment was conducted in a total of 384 plots in which tree crowns (0–4) from logging residuals were used as increasingly dense physical barriers to shelter five newly planted saplings of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.). Generalized linear mixed-effects models were applied to determine whether sapling browsing by roe deer and rodents was differentially affected by these barriers. The probability of roe deer browsing decreased from 26% (no crowns) to 2% (4 crowns) while that of rodent browsing increased from 1% to 17%, respectively, as the number of deadwood crowns used in barrier construction increased. In broadleaf stands, browsing by roe deer and rodents was generally higher than in coniferous stands. In forests with high numbers of visitors, browsing by roe deer was reduced, but browsing by rodents was not influenced. The retention of large amounts of deadwood or active deadwood increments may thus provide an effective barrier to roe deer browsing but promote the browsing activity of rodents. The landscape-level heterogeneity of browsing patterns associated with the presence of deadwood suggests that deadwood shelters in homogenized forests may encourage both natural forest regeneration and forest biodiversity, despite an overabundance of roe deer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Seedbanks are essential for forest resilience, and disturbance interactions could potentially modify seedbank availability, subsequent forest regeneration patterns, and successional trajectories. Regional mountain pine beetle outbreaks have altered forest structure and seedbanks in fire prone-landscapes across western North America and could influence forest regeneration. We examined the drivers of lodgepole pine recruitment across a gradient of fire severity from fire that burned through gray-phase outbreak conditions in central interior British Columbia, Canada. We considered ten potential drivers of lodgepole pine recruitment including: fire severity, mountain pine beetle outbreak severity, cone abundance, branch retention, open cones, exposed soil, snag fall, snow accumulation, climate moisture deficit, and frost events, as well as the contribution of unburned fire refugia to lodgepole pine recruitment. In 2016, we inventoried 83 plots that spanned gradients of outbreak severity, burning conditions, and fire severity across three fires that burned through lodgepole pine dominated forests with gray-phase conditions that had moderate to high mortality. We used generalized linear models to evaluate drivers of variability in seedling recruitment. Our analyses affirm that wildfire is a critical mechanism for lodgepole pine seedling recruitment. For plots that burned as crown and surface fire, recruitment densities were two or six times greater compared plots that experienced light surface or were fire refugia, respectively. Recruitment was driven by cone abundance indicating the importance of an available seed source. In fire refugia, recruitment was three times greater during the post-outbreak period compared to before outbreaks, suggesting cone senescence from mortality and/or xeriscent-cueing of cones. The unevenness in recruitment across gradients of outbreak and fire severity contribute to the heterogeneity of stand initiation across these landscapes that may be important for mediation of subsequent outbreaks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aims to characterize at landscape level the spatio-temporal dynamics of a massive oak decline that is occurring in dehesas ecosystems. We are looking at possibilities of matching with Phytophthora disease behavior, a harmful disease detected in the studied area, in order to interpret its implications within the context of the disease management. Spatial locations of affected trees from 2001, 2009 and 2016 identified through photointerpretation were analyzed with the inhomogeneous Ripley's K-function to assess their spatial pattern. Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), a non-parametric data mining method, was used to investigate the influence of a range of landscape descriptors of different nature on the proneness to oak decline, using the location of affected trees in comparison with that of healthy spots (points randomly extracted from areas covered by healthy trees). Affected trees showed a strong clustering pattern that decreased over time. The reported spatial patterns align with the hypothesis of Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands. being the main cause of oak decline in Mediterranean forests. Location of affected trees detected in different years was found to be spatially related, suggesting the implication of a contagion process. MARS models from 2001, 2009 and 2016 reported Area Under the Curve (AUC) values of 0.707, 0.671 and 0.651, respectively. Slope was the most influential landscape descriptor across the three years, with distance to afforestations being the second for 2001 and 2009. Landscape descriptors linked to human factors and soil water content seem to influence oak decline caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi at landscape level. Afforestations carried out as part of the afforestation subsidy program promoted by the European Commission in 1992 could have acted as an initial source of Phytophthora cinnamomi infection. These findings together with the consideration of the spatial and temporal scale of the spreading are essential when planning the management of oak decline in open woodlands. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although invasive trees species spread effectively across different habitats, data on survival of their seedlings are scarce. We compared seedling survival after the first year from germination for the three most invasive tree species in temperate Europe. We also assessed the impact of light availability, parental tree stands and intra- and inter-specific competition. We studied seedlings of three invasive species: Prunus serotina Ehrh., Quercus rubra L. and Robinia pseudoacacia L., in a set of 186 study plots in W Poland over three years (2015–2018). In total, we labelled 11,135 seedlings. We assessed importance of variables using machine learning techniques. Mean seedling survival was 3.9 ± 1.2%, 12.5 ± 2.2% and 0.1 ± 0.1% for P. serotina, Q. rubra and R. pseudoacacia respectively, and was higher than for native species. Survival of Q. rubra seedlings depended mostly on intraspecific competition in understory, light availability and parental trees availability. Survival of P. serotina seedlings depended mostly on intra- and inter-specific competition, germination year (precipitation seasonality) and light availability. Our study explained that despite the high seedling densities of invasive species beneath parental tree canopies, their survival was lower than in surrounding forests. These two aspects of the establishment process (seedling abundance and survival) contribute to the dynamic equilibrium between limiting (low survival beneath maternal tree canopies) and facilitating (high seedling densities beneath maternal trees canopies) the growth of young generations of invasive tree species. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Intercropping the sharp-leaf galangal with the rubber tree could help to improve the sustainability of the rubber tree planting industry. However, our understanding of belowground competition in such agroforestry systems is still limited. Therefore, we used stable isotope methods (i.e., water δ2H and δ18O and leaf δ13C) to investigate plant water-absorbing patterns and water use efficiency (WUE) in a monocultural rubber plantation and in an agroforestry system of rubber trees and sharp-leaf galangal. We also measured leaf carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) to evaluate the belowground competition effects on plant nutrient absorption status. Through a Bayesian mixing model, we found that the monocultural rubber trees and the intercropped sharp-leaf galangal absorbed much more surface soil water at a depth of 0-5 cm, while the rubber trees in the agroforestry system absorbed more water from the shallow and middle soil layers at a depth of 5-30 cm. This phenomenon verified the occurrence of plant hydrologic niche segregation, whereas the WUE of rubber trees in this agroforestry system suggested that the competition for water was weak. In addition, the negative correlation between the leaf P concentration of the rubber trees and that of the sharp-leaf galangal demonstrated their competition for soil P resources, but this competition had no obvious effects on the leaf nutrient status of the rubber trees. Therefore, this study verified that the belowground competition between rubber trees and sharp-leaf galangal is weak, and this weak competition may benefit their long-term intercropping. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve (FNNR) in China is a biodiversity hotspot that is part of a larger, multi-use landscape where tourism, farming, grazing, and other land uses occur. Payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs that encourage afforestation on farmlands may be important drivers of land-cover and land-use change in the region that surrounds FNNR. Our objective is to monitor and examine vegetation and land-use changes, including PES-related afforestation, between 1989 and 2017. We utilize several image processing techniques, such as illumination normalization approaches to suppress terrain effects, and multi-seasonal image compositing to minimize persistent cloud cover. Ancillary data were also incorporated to generate reliable vegetation and land-use change information. A random forest machine learning image classification routine is implemented through the cloud-based Google Earth Engine platform and refined using optimal classifier parameter tuning. Land-use transitions are identified and mapped with the implementation of stable training sites, discrete image classification, and logical land-use transition rules. Accuracy assessment results indicate our change detection workflow provides a reliable methodology to remotely monitor long-term forest cover and land-use changes in this mountainous, forested, and cloud prevalent region. We quantify the area of new built development and afforestation land and found that most of the land transitions took place in reserve buffer and its adjacent environs. For example, less than 2 km2 of new built was identified within the reserve boundary compared to 25 km2 for the entire study area between 1995 and 2016. We also shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of using Google Earth Engine for land-cover and land-use change studies. This efficient and open-access technique is important not only for assessing environmental changes and PES efficacy, but also for evaluating other conservation policies elsewhere. © 2019

AB  - Human activities and natural processes over millennia have shaped the forest landscapes of European mountain ranges. In the Apennines, the second largest range in Italy, the post–World War II abandonment of traditional activities has led to forest expansion. Previous analyses of land use change related to forest landscape were performed for relatively small localities and used different sampling protocols. Consequently, a replicate landscape approach and a systematic sampling design were crucial for quantifying changes at the regional scale. We investigated land cover change and landscape configurational shifts comparing different slope exposures and altitudinal zones and discussed the main drivers affecting post-agricultural forest dynamics. We selected two paired study landscapes (North-East vs South-West) of 16 km2 for each of 10 sites located along the entire range. We applied object-based classification to aerial photography from 1954 and 2012, resulting in 40 land cover maps. We assessed (i) overall landscape changes by computing land cover transitions, (ii) landscape patterns through key metrics, and (iii) reforestation dynamics through multivariate statistics and binomial generalized linear models (GLMs). Apennine landscape mosaics experienced structural simplification at lower elevation due to tree establishment in abandoned pastures, but a diffuse fragmentation of historical grasslands at higher elevation due to development of woody vegetation patches beyond the forest-grassland ecotone. Forest expansion occurred more rapidly at lower elevations, on steeper slopes, and closer to existing forests and cultivated areas. A replicate landscape approach proved useful for quantifying changes to forest cover and landscape structure along complex gradients of topography and land use history, following a diffuse agro-pastoral abandonment. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Streamflow dynamics are sensitive to both climate variability and land use change. However, estimating their separate and combined effects remains a research challenge. In South Africa, streamflow dynamics are important not only for irrigated agriculture but also for many rural communities that depend on streamflow for domestic water supply. In this paper, we analysed the effects of pine, wattle and eucalyptus plantation cover change vis-à-vis the effects of inter-annual climate variability on streamflow dynamics of the Upper Umvoti River in South Africa from 1994 to 2016. We modelled inter-annual variability in streamflow by precipitation, temperature and plantation cover using the Bayesian inference. We mapped plantation cover from Landsat satellite imagery. We found strong evidence for an interaction between temperature range and plantation cover net change on streamflow. Specifically, the plantation effect weakened under conditions of high-temperature range anomalies. We explain this interaction with a shift in soil water repellency and interception capacity within the plantation area under a changing temperature range, with important implications for the formation of surface runoff. Previous studies have assumed that the effects of climate variability and plantation cover change on streamflow dynamics are independent. Our results call this assumption into question. Hence, climate and land cover interdependencies should be accounted for in future statistical and process-based modelling studies. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - One long-standing, unresolved issue in forest management is how to achieve high levels of biodiversity conservation and commercial forestry for timber production. Retaining fallen logs on the forest floor is effective in preserving the habitats essential for many wood-dwelling organisms. However, the contributions of fallen logs toward the plant species diversity of forest understories are less clear, even though the importance of fallen logs on the emergence and survival of coniferous seedlings and saplings is well known, especially in boreal forests. This study aimed to clarify the roles of fallen logs in the maintenance of species diversity of understory vascular plants in forests. We investigated species richness and the composition of vascular plants on 319 fallen logs and in 128 forest-floor quadrats (2 × 2 m) in a 4-ha plot in a mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest in Hokkaido, northern Japan. We also measured canopy openness in summer, surface area, wood resistance, and moss cover of fallen logs, and soil thickness in forest-floor quadrats. Additive partitioning and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) were used to examine differences in composition between quadrats and fallen logs. Generalized linear model (GLM) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were also applied to test the determinants of species richness and composition in quadrats and fallen logs. In total, 83 vascular plant species were identified. For woody and herbaceous plants, several species occurred predominantly on fallen logs in comparison with quadrats. Species richness of woody plants on fallen logs was positively affected by surface area and moss cover, and negatively by wood resistance; although in quadrats it was not significantly associated with any environmental factors. Herbaceous species richness on fallen logs was also negatively influenced by wood resistance. In contrast, herbaceous species richness in quadrats was positively associated with canopy openness. These results suggest that fallen logs promote plant species diversity, including herbaceous plants, by creating habitat conditions favored in forest understory environments. This study implies that leaving fallen logs on the forest floor at logging sites contributes toward plant diversity conservation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Judging and predicting tree suitability is of great significance in the cultivation and management of forests. Background and Objectives: Due to the diversity of tree species for afforestation in China and the lack of experts or the limitations of expert knowledge, the site rules of tree species in some regions are lacking or incomplete, so that a small number of tree suitability empirical site rules are difficult to adapt to the afforestation expert system's diverse needs. Research Highlights: This paper explores an intelligent method to automatically extract rules for selecting favorable site conditions (tree suitability site rules) from a large amount of data to solve the problem of knowledge acquisition, updating and maintenance of suitable forest site rules in the expert system. Materials and Methods: Based on the method of site quality evaluation and the theory of the decision tree in knowledge discovery and machine learning, the dominant species of Chinese fir and Masson pine in the forest resources subcompartment data (FRSD) of Jinping County, Guizhou Province were taken as examples to select the important site factors affecting the forest quality and based on the site quality of potential productivity. Assessment methodology was proposed to determine the afforestation of a stand site by nonlinear quantile regression, the decision tree was constructed from the ID3, C5.0 and CART algorithms. Results: Finally, the best-performing CART algorithm was selected to construct the model, and the extractor of the afforestation rules was constructed. After validating the rules for selecting favorable site conditions of Chinese fir and Masson pine, the production representation method was used to construct the relationship model of the knowledge base. Conclusions: Intelligent extraction of suitable tree rules for afforestation design in an expert system was realized, which provided the theoretical basis and technical support for afforestation land planning and design. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In the Mediterranean Basin, wildland fires are major drivers of forest ecosystem dynamics. In the current context of global change, these fires are becoming more severe and recurrent because of climatic conditions, land use changes and invasive species. In areas affected by mega-fires (burned area > 10,000 ha), the patterns of regeneration may be heterogeneous due to local variations in fire regime, community composition and environmental features. The goal of this study was to analyze the post-fire structure of both Pinus pinaster Aiton. seedlings population and understory community in a Mediterranean fire-prone ecosystem at short-term by means of high spatial resolution satellite imagery within the perimeter of a full stand replacing mega-fire that burned around 12,000 ha of a Pinus pinaster forest in NW Spain. We established 234 field plots of 2 × 2 meters to cover four recurrence-severity scenarios. In each plot, we sampled 15 vegetation structural variables at both pine seedlings population and understory community levels. From the WorldView-2 satellite imagery, we obtained three sets of spectral variables (reflectance, spectral indices and image textures) that were used as predictors of vegetation recovery in generalized linear models. At population level, the number and cover of pine seedlings were successfully modeled with spectral indices and textural information (normalized root mean square error of 16% and 17%, respectively). At understory community level, woody species cover was correlated with first order textures (normalized root mean square error of 9%). Other understory structure variables (height and richness of woody species, percentage of bare soil, necromass and leaves) were predicted with an error lower than 20%. The predictive capacity of the models was similar for all recurrence-severity scenarios. Our results highlight the usefulness of spectral indices and textural data at high spatial resolution in the analysis of post-fire recovery in large and heterogeneous burnt areas. Given the accuracy and predictive capacity of the models obtained in this study, high spatial resolution satellite imagery together with field data provide useful information in post-fire decision making in fire prone ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The ecological impact of forest product harvesting is poorly understood despite the reliance of millions of impoverished households on forest resources. As birds are indicators of environmental change and essential for the function and regeneration of forest ecosystems, this study aimed to assess the response of bird species richness and functional diversity to unregulated forest product harvesting, to illuminate the impact of harvest disturbances on forest biodiversity. Five forest ecotypes in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa were sampled by means of circular plots in which bird communities, habitat structure and harvest intensities of sub-canopy trees harvested for poles, canopy trees harvested for timber, and bark harvested for medicinal use, were recorded. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to assess the response of bird diversity to harvesting activities measured on a continuous scale, and forest ecotype. Correlations between feeding traits and environmental variables relating to habitat structure and harvest disturbances were investigated using RLQ and fourth-corner analysis to better understand which traits were sensitive to harvest disturbances. Results indicated that forest ecotype was an important driver of variation in species richness and functional diversity. Additionally, harvesting disturbances negatively affected two measures of functional diversity, while species richness and functional richness were unaffected by harvesting. Specifically, functional evenness was negatively affected by timber harvesting, while functional dispersion declined in response to pole and bark harvesting. Bird traits relating to feeding ecology (i.e. primary diet and foraging strategy) were associated with habitat structure and harvest disturbances, indicating that harvest activities affected community structure. Specifically, frugivores and granivores were negatively affected by pole and bark harvesting respectively, while omnivorous species were positively affected by these harvest activities. Conversely, timber harvesting negatively affected omnivores, and positively affected nectarivores. Bark and timber harvesting, which resulted in canopy gaps, negatively affected species which forage in the understory or on the forest floor, while pole harvesting, which reduced tree abundance but not canopy cover, negatively affected canopy-foraging species. These results suggest that current unregulated forest product harvesting in the Eastern Cape may negatively affect forest productivity and ecosystem functioning. Specifically, this is the first study to measure the effects of harvesting of poles and medicinal bark on the functional diversity of avian forest communities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study proposes a workflow for land use and land cover (LULC) classification of Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) images of the Brazilian tropical savanna (Cerrado) biome. The following LULC classes were considered: forestlands; shrublands; grasslands; reforestations; croplands; pasturelands; bare soils/straws; urban areas; and water reservoirs. The proposed approach combines polarimetric attributes, image segmentation, and machine-learning procedures. A set of 125 attributes was generated using polarimetric ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 images, including the van Zyl, Freeman- Durden, Yamaguchi, and Cloude-Pottier target decomposition components, incoherent polarimetric parameters (biomass indices and polarization ratios), and HH-, HV-, VH-, andVV-polarized amplitude images. These attributes were classified using the Naive Bayes (NB), DT J48 (DT = decision tree), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The RF, MLP, and SVM classifiers presented the most accurate performances. NB and DT J48 classifiers showed a lower performance in relation to the RF, MLP, and SVM. The DT J48 classifier was the most suitable algorithm for discriminating urban areas and natural vegetation cover. The proposed workflow can be replicated for other SAR images with different acquisition modes or for other types of vegetation domains. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Reforestation is a primary factor in protecting upland forests providing economic sustenance for livelihood and keeping watersheds intact. In this study, we evaluated the importance of several direct and indirect drivers that can influence people’s decision for reforestation. Acquiring data from Cao Phong district of Vietnam, we utilized Bayesian Network (BN) to analyze how household characteristics, socio-economic status, biophysical environment, institutional support, and farm characteristics influenced reforestation decisions of local people. BN allowed us to identify 1) the main drivers that affect landholders ‘planted forest area, 2) how the key drivers affect among themselves, and 3) what causes constraints in tree planting. We surveyed 100 households for potential drivers, identified significant drivers by using bivariate analysis and stepwise linear regression, and created a BN to predict scenarios with different household’s perception regarding the planted forest area. The results revealed five direct drivers (attitude of household to tree planting, sources of investment capital for planting practice, land area, distance from household to market, experience of participating in forestry program) and seven indirect drivers (information about forestry program, incentives supported for tree planters, land tenure, accessibility to plantation forest, rotation length of planting trees, forest area, household income) that significantly influenced farmers’ reforestation decisions. Constraints in planting trees were due to the difficulties in protecting property from mortality and unreliable profit. Our results can assist design efficient forestry programs in Vietnam and in other comparable areas. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Since the 1980s, mangrove cover mapping has become a common scientific task. However, the systematic and continuous identification of vegetation cover, whether on a global or regional scale, demands large storage and processing capacities. This manuscript presents a Google Earth Engine (GEE)-managed pipeline to compute the annual status of Brazilian mangroves from 1985 to 2018, along with a new spectral index, the Modular Mangrove Recognition Index (MMRI), which has been specifically designed to better discriminate mangrove forests from the surrounding vegetation. If compared separately, the periods from 1985 to 1998 and 1999 to 2018 show distinct mangrove area trends. The first period, from 1985 to 1998, shows an upward trend, which seems to be related more to the uneven distribution of Landsat data than to a regeneration of Brazilian mangroves. In the second period, from 1999 to 2018, a trend of mangrove area loss was registered, reaching up to 2% of the mangrove forest. On a regional scale, ~85% of Brazil's mangrove cover is in the states of Maranhão, Pará, Amapá and Bahia. In terms of persistence, ~75% of the Brazilian mangroves remained unchanged for two decades or more. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Multiple use of communal forests requires informed management to balance divergent interests such as livestock grazing and timber production. In this study, we examined the habitat selection of free-ranging beef cattle in two vegetation-mapped communal forests of Norway's boreal zone. The two areas were 35 km apart, and they mainly differed regarding cattle stocking density, with one being below and the other above the livestock grazing capacity of the area. In total, 78 cows were fitted with global positioning system (GPS) collars during the summers 2015 to 2017. The collars were scheduled to take positions and measure activity at 5 and 10 min intervals. We applied generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to describe the cows’ selection of vegetation types, forest cutting classes, topographical features and distance to roads with resource selection functions (RSF), by comparing use with availability. The most selected vegetation types were wide-spread summer farm meadows, followed by the dominant bilberry spruce forest. In productive forest, the cows selected for clearcuts younger than 15 years and used thinning and post-thinning stands less than expected. In accordance with the Ideal free distribution hypothesis, the cows were more likely to use low productive habitats in the area with high compared to the one with low stocking density. The preference for young forest stands was strongest when grazing as compared to resting and walking. During grazing, the cows also preferred pre-thinning stands older than 15 years and inclined patches, but avoided north-facing slopes. Preference for south-facing slopes was strongest when resting and for forest roads when traveling. To reduce the pressure of cattle in forest regeneration stands, we suggest limiting stocking densities to the grazing capacity of forest pastures, using vegetation and forest maps as information to guide the distribution of cattle, and maintaining or even expanding the existing meadows of the summer farms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tropical rain forests are suffering the highest deforestation and reforestation ever recorded. Interactions between direct (proximate or direct causes) and indirect (underling or indirect causes) drivers could cluster these forest cover changes forming hotspots (areas that exhibit significant spatial correlation of deforestation or reforestation transitions). Using land use–land cover maps and global (I) and local (Ii) Moran's tests, we identified these hotspots in the Chocó-Darien Global Ecoregion (CGE) of South America, a natural region that was declared one of the top 25 hotspots for conservation priorities in the world. Subsequently, we tested and studied the effects and interactions between deforestation and reforestation hotspots and their direct and indirect drivers using Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling (Bayesian SEM). We found that deforestation and reforestation were spatially auto-correlated forming hotspots (I = 0.49, P = 0.001 for deforestation transitions and I = 0.48, P = 0.001 for reforestation transitions). Also, hotspots of deforestation and reforestation were auto-correlated within municipality borders (I = 0.5, P = 0.001 for deforestation transitions; I = 0.49, P = 0.001 for reforestation transitions). Eighteen municipalities located on the border between Colombia and Ecuador showed significant aggregations of deforestation hotspots, while thirty-four municipalities in three areas of Colombia and the area between the Colombian and Ecuadorian border showed significant clustering of reforestation hotspots. Eleven of these municipalities presented significant clustering of both reforestation and deforestation hotspots. The Bayesian SEM for deforestation showed that population growth and road density were indirect drivers of deforestation hotspots (0.191 and 0.127 standard deviation units). The Bayesian SEM for reforestation found that armed conflicts, Gross Domestic Product, and average annual rain were indirect drivers related to reforestation hotspots (0.228, 0.076, and 0.081 standard deviation units, respectively). Our assessment shows a novel methodology to study interactions among direct and indirect drivers of forest change and their potential dissimilar effects on forest transitions. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Key message: A remnant population ofAnadenanthera colubrinavar.cebilin Northern Argentina showed a mixed mating system, high genetic diversity, and moderate spatial genetic structure, which was stronger in saplings than in adults. Demographic history analyses revealed an ancient population expansion. Despite high genetic diversity, high inbreeding suggests caution in the use of this stand as seed source. Context: Information on fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) and demographic history is essential to determine which mechanisms are responsible for population persistence and evolution. This is particularly important in fragmented biomes, such as the seasonally dry tropical forests. Aims: To assess the level of genetic diversity and population genetic structure in a remnant population of A. colubrina var. cebil, and to evaluate the influence of historical and contemporary environmental change on the genetic constitution of this population. Methods: Eight microsatellites were typed in 60 adults and 59 saplings. The existence of (non-spatial) genetic clusters was evaluated using STRUCTURE and PCAs. FSGS was evaluated by kinship analyses and sPCA. MCMCglmm models were used to provide insights into factors underlying FSGS. Demographic history was studied using bottleneck statistics and approximate Bayesian computation. Results: We found high levels of genetic diversity and high inbreeding. Genetic structure was stronger in saplings than in adult trees, probably due to assortative mating, and was not explained by altitude or DBH. Demographic analyses suggested an ancient population expansion. Conclusion: Patterns of inbreeding and relatedness suggest a mixed mating system. High genetic diversity and moderate genetic structure suggest long-term population viability. High inbreeding suggests caution when using this stand as a source of material for reforestation. © 2019, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The concern regarding the re-establishment of coppice forests has increased with respect to biodiversity conservation, bioenergy, and ecological services. To successfully restore the oak dominated coppices, understanding the factors affecting sprout regeneration is necessary because stump sprouts are the essential source of natural oak regeneration. In the present study, therefore, we sought to determine the stump sprout dynamics of the two widely distributed oaks in Japan, Quercus serrata and Q. acutissima, in relation to stump size, sprout characteristics, topographic factors, and canopy closure over a 4-year period following cutting in abandoned coppices. The study plot (40 × 90 m) was established in a coppice forest abandoned since the 1960s in western Japan. In winter 2013, canopy trees within and outside the plot were cut, then we collected the data of sprout origin position, sprout survival, sprout diameter, and length from 2014 to 2017. Four years after cutting, the proportion of surviving stumps decreased to 37% (n = 98) and 56% (n = 61) in Q. serrata and Q. acutissima, respectively. In both species, the Bayesian logistic mixed model showed that stump survival was not significantly affected by stump size and the examined environmental factors. The number of living sprouts per stump differed between Q. serrata (8.7 ± 6.7) and Q. acutissima (5.1 ± 4.6) after four years (P = 0.01). The number of sprouts per stump in both species tended to increase with stump diameter and was greater in convex area, but only significant for Q. acutissima. Dominant sprouts of Q. acutissima exhibited greater diameter and length than those of Q. serrata, and the relative growth rate of sprouts in both species decreased with time after cutting. Dominant sprouts originating from a higher position on the stump grew better than those closer to the ground level. Sprout growth was negatively affected by sprout number per clump and positively affected by dead sprout number per stump, but only significant for Q. serrata. Light availability positively, although modestly, influenced sprout growth. Our data suggest that relying only on stump sprouts to restore the abandoned coppice stands dominated by the two species is insufficient because their stump survival rate was relatively low. Within the observed range of stump diameter, it may not be a factor responsible for the regeneration failure in the two species. Artificial thinning of small and suppressed sprouts may promote the growth of the remaining dominant sprouts. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forest parameters have been estimated using various regression methods based on satellite data. However, there are a few concerns regarding further application of these predicted parameters. Current forest quality (FQ) assessments are mainly based on forest parameters collected in the field. To evaluate FQ quickly and comprehensively, forest parameters estimated from satellite images can be used. Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) plantations have experienced increases in tree mortality and reductions in tree growth caused by human destruction and poor natural conditions on the Loess Plateau. Assessing the FQ of the black locust plantations in these areas is critical. In this study, four machine learning algorithms (MLAs) – classification and regression tree (CART), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) – were first implemented and compared regarding their ability to estimate forest parameters of black locust plantations on the Loess Plateau. The results indicated that among the four MLAs, the CART method achieved the lowest accuracy, the SVM and ANN methods had moderate performances, and the RF obtained the highest accuracy and lowest error for all forest parameter estimates. As a result, the RF algorithm was chosen to predict the forest parameters. The highest R2 values among the forest parameters were predicted for the diameter at breast height (DBH, R2 = 0.85 and relative root mean square error (rRMSE) = 0.18), and the lowest R2 values were predicted for the forest aboveground biomass (AGB, R2 = 0.66 and rRMSE = 0.25). These predicted forest parameters as well as the topographic factors derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) were used to assess the FQ of the study area. Among the four stand age classes, the middle-aged forest had the lowest proportion of poor quality forests (7%) and the highest proportion of good quality forests (52%), whereas overmature forests presented a moderate proportion of poor quality forests (23%) and good quality forests (21%). These results provide the necessary foundation for forest management and guidance for regional reforestation on the Loess Plateau. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although typically considered shade-intolerant, Mediterranean pine species may form seedling banks due to the existence of facilitative interactions between seedlings and canopy trees. Consequently, seedling banks could be considered as part of the seedling pool that should restock managed Mediterranean pinewoods, thus increasing the resistance of these forests to climate change. The study investigated the characteristics of the seedling bank in a silviculturally undisturbed forest of Pinus nigra subsp. salzmanii exposed to increasingly arid conditions. The study site was located in the southernmost range limit of the species. The dynamics of the seedling bank was studied by comparing current seedling (height < 1.30 m, age < 2 yr) and pole tree (height ≥ 1.30 m and diameter at breast height < 12.5 cm) altitudinal distributions, using altitude as a proxy of aridity. Aridity was proved to have increased in the study area along the last four decades. These climatic trends were identified by means of Mann-Kendall tests for trend. Additionally, the effects of summer drought, light availability, soil compaction, litter layer and micro-slope as explanatory variables of the recruitment outcome were analysed by means of Generalized Linear Mixed Models and survival analysis. Altitude affected positively seedling establishment, but had no effect on the current abundance of pole trees, indicating a recent upwards displacement of the regeneration niche due to increasingly arid conditions. Water and light availability, the latter at intermediate levels of irradiance, affected tree recruitment positively, whereas the effects of soil compaction, litter layer depth and micro-slope were negative. Implementing extended rotation periods and maintaining intermediate values of tree cover are proposed as important management recommendations to achieve successful natural regeneration in Mediterranean pinewoods. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The carbon accounting model FullCAM is used in Australia's National Greenhous Gas Inventory to provide estimates of carbon stock changes and emissions in response to deforestation and afforestation/reforestation. FullCAM-predicted above-ground woody biomass is heavily influenced by the parameter M, which defines the maximum upper limit to biomass accumulation for any location within the Australian continent. In this study we update FullCAM's M spatial input layer through combining an extensive database of 5739 site-based records of above-ground biomass (AGB) with the Random Forest ensemble machine learning algorithm, with model predictions of AGB based on 23 environmental predictor covariates. A Monte-Carlo approach was used, allowing estimates of uncertainty to be calculated. Overall, the new biomass predictions for woodlands, with 20–50% canopy cover, were on average 49.5 ± 1.3 (s.d.) t DM ha−1, and very similar to existing model predictions of 48.5 t DM ha−1. This validates the original FullCAM model calibrations, which had a particular focus on accounting for greenhouse gas emissions in Australian woodlands. In contrast, the prediction of biomass of forests with a canopy cover &gt;50% increased significantly, from 172.1 t DM ha−1, to 234.4 ± 5.1 t DM ha−1. The change in forest biomass was most pronounced at sub-continental scales, with the largest increases in the states of Tasmania (166 to 351 ± 22 t DM ha−1), Victoria (201 to 333 ± 14 t DM ha−1), New South Wales (210 to 287 ± 9 t DM ha−1), and Western Australia (103 to 264 ± 14 s.d. t DM ha−1). Testing of model predictions against independent data from the savanna woodlands of northern Australia, and from the high biomass Eucalyptus regnans forests of Victoria, provided confidence in the predictions across a wide range of forest types and standing biomass. When applied to the Australian Government's National Inventory land clearing accounts there was an overall increase of 6% in continental emissions over the period 1970–2016. Greater changes were seen at sub-continental scales calculated within 6° × 4° analysis tiles, with differences in emissions varying from −21% to +35%. Further testing is required to assess the impacts on other land management activities covered by the National Inventory, such as reforestation; and at more local scales for sequestration projects that utilise FullCAM for determining abatement credits. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Vigorous aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) regeneration immediately following a harvesting event is important to ensuring the continued health and productivity of the future forest. This study aimed to examine the potential of using unoccupied aerial vehicle, multispectral remote sensing, and GIS mapping techniques to develop a comprehensive approach for predicting aspen regeneration success at the harvest block scale. Three winter harvested blocks were studied at Duck Mountain Provincial Park in east-central Saskatchewan, Canada. Ten regeneration predictor variables (number of skidder passes, percentage slash coverage, topographic wetness index, slope, aspect, slope position, and four vegetation indices: green normalized vegetation index [GNDVI], normalized red-edge index [NDRE], simple RED to NIR ratio [SR], and chlorophyll index green [CIG]) were determined for 168 measurement plots 1 yr after harvest. Principal component analysis, principal component regression, fuzzy logic analysis, and GIS mapping techniques, were combined for the first time in this study to determine cumulative effects on aspen regeneration. On average, low suitability areas had significantly more skidder traffic (34 passes) compared to below average (17), above average (10), and high (7) suitability areas. Low suitability areas also had significantly more slash coverage (13.1%) compared to below average (8.49%) or high suitability land (7.18%). High suitability areas had significantly higher GNDVI, NDRE, SR, and CIG indices, compared to low and below average suitability land. Not only does this method of analysis help to assess how a combination of factors may influence aspen regeneration, it can also act as a decision support system tool for industry, or government, to improve aspen regeneration assessments. © 2019 Soil Science Society of America.

AB  - The frequent fine-scale monitoring of deforestation using satellite sensors is important for the sustainable management of forests. Traditional optical satellite sensors suffer from cloud interruption, particularly in tropical regions, and recent active microwave sensors (i.e., synthetic aperture radar) demonstrate the difficulty in data interpretation owing to their inherent sensor noise and complicated backscatter features of forests. Although the sensor integration of optical and microwave sensors is of compelling research interest, particularly in the conduct of deforestation monitoring, this topic has not been widely studied. In this paper, we introduce an operational algorithm for automated deforestation mapping using long-term optical and L-band SAR data, including a simple time-series analysis of Landsat stacks and a multilayered neural network with Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer and Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2, followed by sensor integration based on the Bayesian Updating of Land-Cover. We applied the algorithm over a deciduous tropical forest in Cambodia in 2003-2018 for validation, and the algorithm demonstrated better accuracy than existing approaches, which only depend on optical data or SAR data. Owing to the cloud penetration ability of SAR, observation gaps of optical data under cloudy conditions were filled, resulting in a prompter detection of deforestation even in the tropical rainy season. We also investigated the effect of posterior probability constraints in the Bayesian approach. The land-cover maps (forest/deforestation) created by the well-tuned Bayesian approach achieved 94.0% ± 4.5%, 80.0% ± 10.1%, and 96.4% ± 1.9% for the user's accuracy, producer's accuracy, and overall accuracy, respectively. In the future, small-scale commission errors in the resultant maps should be improved by using more sophisticated machine-learning approaches and considering the reforestation effects in the algorithm. The application of the algorithm to other landscapes with other sensor combinations is also desirable. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Driver perception, decision, and control behaviors are easily affected by traffic conditions and driving style, showing the tendency of randomness and personalization. Brake intention and intensity are integrated and control-oriented parameters that are crucial to the development of an intelligent braking system. In this paper, a composite machine learning approach was proposed to predict driver brake intention and intensity with a proper prediction horizon. Various driving data were collected from Controller Area Network (CAN) bus under a real driving condition, which mainly contained urban and rural road types. ReliefF and RReliefF (they don't have abbreviations) algorithms were employed as feature subset selection methods and applied in a prepossessing step before the training. The rank importance of selected predictors exhibited different trends or even negative trends when predicting brake intention and intensity. A soft clustering algorithm, Fuzzy C-means, was adopted to label the brake intention into categories, namely slight, medium, intensive, and emergency braking. Data sets with misplaced labels were used for training of an ensemble machine learning method, random forest. It was validated that brake intention could be accurately predicted 0.5 s ahead. An open-loop nonlinear autoregressive with external input (NARX) network was capable of learning the long-term dependencies in comparison to the static neural network and was suggested for online recognition and prediction of brake intensity 1 s in advance. As system redundancy and fault tolerance, a close-loop NARX network could be adopted for brake intensity prediction in the case of possible sensor failure and loss of CAN message. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Boswellia serrata, a commercially important species for its pulp and pharmaceutical properties was sampled from three locations representing its natural distribution in central India for genetic characterisation through 56 RAPD + 42 ISSR loci. The wood fibre dimensions measured for morphometric characterisation confirmed 11.36% variation in length and 8.75% variation in width, indicating its fitness for local adaptation. Bayesian and non-Bayesian approach based diversity measures resulted moderately within population gene diversity (0.26 ± 0.17), Shannon's information index (0.40 ± 0.22) and panmictic heterozygosity (0.28 ± 0.01). A high estimate for genetic differentiation measures i.e. GST (0.31), GST-B (0.33 ± 0.02) and θ-II (0.45) led to distinct clusters of sampled genotypes, representing their regional variability due to limited gene flow and total absence of natural regeneration. This study reports the first investigation of the species for its molecular characterisation emphasising the urgent need for a genetic improvement program for in-situ/ ex-situ conservation and sustainable commercialisation. © 2019 Forest Research Institute Malaysia.

AB  - There are various methodologies for defining soil uses to promote sustainable utilization of rural land. Many of these methods rely on decision support systems based on multicriteria spatial analysis. In this study, a two-step spatial approach was performed to produce forest species suitability maps. The objectives of the study were: (1) to produce bioclimatic indices maps using a geostatistical approach based on climate data; (2) to produce biogeophysical suitability maps for the main Portuguese forest species by multicriteria spatial analysis using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) integrating three factors (terrain slope, soil diagnostic features and bioclimatic indices); and (3) to conduct a comparative analysis of the current forest species area distributions to these species biogeophysical suitability areas. With these objectives, the Centro region of Portugal was used as the study area. Our methodological approach allowed us to assess the biogeophysical suitability of Maritime pine, Eucalyptus, Cork oak and Holm oak in the Centro region of Portugal. The findings in this study emphasize the potential that the Centro region of Portugal has for expanding the spread of native oaks as recommended by the National Strategy for Forests to respond to climate changes, improve landscape biodiversity and mitigate fire hazards. The species biogeophysical suitability maps may be important tools for decision support in landscape planning to define species’ priority afforestation areas. From an instrumental point of view, the use of this methodology may interest stakeholders and others with roles in planning and land management. Further investigation is needed to integrate the impact of climate change in forest species spatial modeling to assist in supporting future national strategies for forests. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Direct assessment of forest regeneration from remote sensing data is a previously little-explored problem. This is due to several factors which complicate object detection of small trees in the understory. Most existing studies are based on airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, which often has insufficient point densities in the understory forest layers. The present study uses plot-based terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and the survey design was similar to traditional forest inventory practices. Furthermore, a framework of methods was developed to solve the difficulties of detecting understory trees for quantifying regeneration in temperate montane forest. Regeneration is of special importance in our montane study area, since large parts are declared as protection forest against alpine natural hazards. Close to nature forest structures were tackled by separating 3D tree stem detection from overall tree segmentation. In support, techniques from 3D mathematical morphology, Hough transformation and state-of-the-art machine learning were applied. The methodical framework consisted of four major steps. These were the extraction of the tree stems, the estimation of the stem diameters at breast height (DBH), the image segmentation into individual trees and finally, the separation of two groups of regeneration. All methods were fully automated and utilized volumetric 3D image information which was derived from the original point cloud. The total amount of regeneration was split into established regeneration, consisting of trees with a height > 130 cm in combination with a DBH < 12 cm and unestablished regeneration, consisting of trees with a height < 130 cm. Validation was carried out against field-based expert estimates of percentage ground cover, differentiating seven classes that were similar to those used by forest inventory. The mean absolute error (MAE) of our method for established regeneration was 1.11 classes and for unestablished regeneration only 0.27 classes. Considering the metrical distances between the class centres, the MAE amounted 8.08% for established regeneration and 2.23% for unestablished regeneration. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Saraca asoca (Roxb.) De Wilde is a valuable tree used in traditional medicine against a variety of ailments. Almost all parts of the tree are used for various commercial herbal preparations. Due to overexploitation, the species is rapidly disappearing from Western Ghats where it is native and grew extensively until recently. Conservation of this important medicinal plant is therefore an urgent need. To plan effective conservation strategies, a scientific assessment of the genetic diversity and distribution is needed. Methods: Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA fingerprinting was employed and the population genetic structure of seven wild and three cultivated populations totalling 160 individuals of S. asoca in the Western Ghats region of Karnataka, Maharashtra and Goa for analysis. Results: Variation of 89% was observed within populations while 11% was observed among the populations of S. asoca. Gene flow (Nm) of 2.01 was observed, and 0.19 was the degree of genetic differentiation recorded. Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic average (UPGMA) cluster analysis generated a dendrogram that showed an admixture of all genotypes but with two major clusters, which was also supported by a STRUCTURE-based Bayesian model. One wild population was well, but inexplicably, differentiated from the rest. Conclusions: The study shows that there is still considerable genetic diversity existing in natural populations of S. asoca, suggesting good natural cross-pollination, giving encouraging indications that the gene pool is under no immediate threat. Any conservation strategy should utilise the observed genetic variation in the choice of planting stock for programmes of conservation, propagation and reforestation. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The main productivity constraints of milling operations are self-induced vibrations, especially regenerative chatter vibrations. Two key parameters are linked to these vibrations: the depth of cut achievable without vibrations and the chatter frequency. Both parameters are linked to the dynamics of machine component excitation and the milling operation parameters. Their identification in any cutting direction in milling machine operations requires complex analytical models and mechatronic simulations, usually only applied to identify the worst cutting conditions in operating machines. This work proposes the use of machine learning techniques with no need to calculate the two above-mentioned parameters by means of a 3-step strategy. The strategy combines: 1) experimental frequency responses collected at the tool center point; 2) analytical calculations of both parameters; and, 3) different machine learning techniques. The results of these calculations can then be used to predict chatter under different combinations of milling directions and machine positions. This strategy is validated with real experiments on a bridge milling machine performing concordance roughing operations on AISI 1045 steel with a 125 mm diameter mill fitted with nine cutters at 45°, the results of which have confirmed the high variability of both parameters along the working volume. The following regression techniques are tested: artificial neural networks, regression trees and Random Forest. The results show that Random Forest ensembles provided the highest accuracy with a statistical advantage over the other machine learning models; they achieved a final accuracy of 0.95 mm for the critical depth and 7.3 Hz for the chatter frequency (RMSE) in the whole working volume and in all feed directions, applying a 10 × 10 cross validation scheme. These RMSE values are acceptable from the industrial point of view, taking into account that the critical depth of this range varies between 0.68 mm and 19.20 mm and the chatter frequency between 1.14 Hz and 65.25 Hz. Besides, Random Forest ensembles are more easily optimized than artificial neural networks (1 parameter configuration versus 210 MLPs). Additionally, tools that incorporate regression trees are interesting and highly accurate, providing immediately accessible and useful information in visual formats on critical machine performance for the design engineer. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the Free State of Thuringia, in Central Germany, the ThüringenForst develops new remote sensing products using open and free data. For this purpose, Copernicus data as well as LiDAR data, and Thuringian GIS database provided by the Agency for Surveying and Geodata (Federal State Thuringia) have been used. Copernicus services combined with auxiliary data can provide at no cost timely and objective information on forest resources that complement and update the existing forest geoinformation. Until now, three products have been available for operational use by ThüringenForst, namely afforestation monitoring, terrain accessibility maps, and tree height maps. Another important forest parameter to monitor is tree species. In this paper, a workflow for classifying tree species has been presented that can be utilized as a future remote sensing local forest product. Using the Sentinel-2 data, five dominant tree species were classified with an overall accuracy of more than 83%. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - In Brazil’s semi-arid Northeast, most rural dwellers derive income from the dry Caatinga forest through livestock farming, fruit collection, and firewood extraction. However, recurring droughts and inadequate land use practices jeopardize farmers’ livelihoods. The drought-resistant, endemic Umbuzeiro tree provides fruit for direct consumption and allows for the creation of transformed products. The planting of this native species can enhance the well-being of the ecosystem and establish future benefits for smallholdings. However, it is crucial that when taking up innovative practices to cope with environmental change, a willingness to apply them should be fostered among local farmers. We used constellation analysis as a transdisciplinary approach to identify elements of current land management which subsequently defined the nodes of a Bayesian network (BN). We developed probabilities of practice uptake that strengthen success, namely the conservation of natural resources while securing the incomes of smallholders. In collaboration with stakeholders and experts, 25 identified nodes for the BN were tested under various scenarios. Adopting all suggested innovative practices secures the final objectives—ecosystem health and farmer benefits (approx. 90%). The analysis quantified the relevance of single issues that may impede farmers to adopt the practices, such as having to cultivate seedlings or avoiding long-term investments. Further crucial actions include the fencing-off of livestock and marketing pathways. Affordable credit, research, and supportive farmers’ institutions can encourage farmers to implement innovative practices. The use of modeled scenarios can provide evidence, which might encourage sustainable land management. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The association between invasive plants and disturbance is well-documented. Most forest management regimes include disturbance (i.e., harvesting and fire) to improve regeneration of native plants, such as oaks. There is a need for land managers of northeastern forests to foster regeneration of native species without promoting invasive species establishment. We evaluated the germination, first-year survival, and growth of three exotic plants (Ailanthus altissima, Alliaria petiolata, and Microstegium vimineum) in 56 uninvaded forest stands located in five management regimes (control, single burn, repeat burn, diameter limit cut, and shelterwood) across two provinces (Appalachian Plateau, AP, and Ridge and Valley, RV) and two slope aspects (north-to-east facing, NE, and south-to-west facing, SW). These results were compared with the native Quercus rubra survival and growth under the same conditions. Two-hundred-fifty seeds and 30 transplants for each species were planted at each site. Germination, survival, and growth were measured three times over one growing season and analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. RV sites had more open canopies, lower soil fertility, and lower plant species richness than AP sites; NE aspects had higher soil fertility and plant species richness than SW aspects. The shelterwood sites had the most open canopies. Germination rates were below 25%, but lowest in the control sites and higher in the RV and on NE aspects for all three species. Survival was above 70% for A. altissima, M. vimineum, and Q. rubra but below 20% for A. petiolata, with little difference among province, aspect, or management regime for all three species. Survival decreased significantly between measurements. Microstegium vimineum grew the most of the three species. Microstegium vimineum and A. petiolata grew best in shelterwoods and better in the RV and on NE aspects. Ailanthus altissima had more root growth in the RV than the AP and the least root growth in the control sites. Quercus rubra survived better in the RV and best in the harvested sites, though growth did not differ among the management regimes. These invasive species are similar to many native species during the early stages of colonization; their germination, survival and growth are initially precarious and dependent on adequate resources (NE aspects) with minimal competition (RV province). Our results suggest that the likelihood of colonization by invasive plants could be reduced by keeping canopy openings below 15% and encouraging native understory competition with deer exclusion and artificial regeneration where native seed sources are depleted. © 2018

AB  - Climatic change is expected to affect forest development in the short term, as well as the spatial distribution of species in the long term. Species distribution models are potentially useful tools for guiding species choices in reforestation and forest management prescriptions to address climate change. The aim of this study is to build spatial and spatio-temporal models to predict the distribution of four different species present in the Spanish Forest Inventory. We have compared the different models and showed how accounting for dependencies in space and time affect the relationship between species and environmental variables. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Oak (Quercus spp.) and hickory (Carya spp.) forests in the eastern United States provide a host of ecosystem services as their mast are prized by wildlife, the timber is a valued commodity, and they are generally more tolerant of extreme weather events under a changing climate. They are, however, undergoing a severe decline in prominence throughout the region, yielding to more mesic and shade-tolerant species, largely red maple (Acer rubrum). Two decades of research in Ohio have shown that silviculture and/or natural disturbances that reduce understory shade during seedling establishment and early growth, followed by canopy opening and competition management through prescribed fire and partial cutting, can encourage oak and hickory regeneration, most successfully on drier ridges and south- and southwest-facing slopes. We employed an ecological classification and mapping approach to prioritize areas across a 17-county region (∼22,000 km2) that may be more receptive, and thus more cost effective, to successful oak regeneration following silvicultural treatment. The ecomapping effort was comprised of two parts; a GIS model of the terrain, and a stand inventory of current vegetation condition coupled with the SILVAH decision-support system to recommend needed silvicultural treatments. The GIS model is based primarily on topography as vegetation patterns in the project area are largely driven by landscape position and soil moisture regimes. It uses transformed aspect, slope angle, topographic position index, and slope position as inputs to define six classes of landtype phases: ridge, southwest upper slopes, southwest lower slopes, northeast upper slopes, northeast lower slopes, and bottomland. The first three and following two classes, respectively, were hierarchically nested to form Dry Oak Forest and Dry-mesic Mixed Oak Hardwood Forest classes at the landtype level. Dry Oak Forests require the least silvicultural intervention to sustain or restore oak, while the other two landtypes normally require serious intervention to sustain oak into the future. To determine whether sufficient stocking is present for adequate regeneration, we use forest inventory data to represent current vegetation conditions including both overstory and understory stocking. Overall, these tools allow managers to identify ‘zones of investment’ i.e., those stands with the bulk of the area in the Dry Oak Forest landtype and with some level of advance oak regeneration, which will have a greater likelihood of growing into oak-dominated stands with minimal investment of scarce funding resources. © 2018

AB  - According facilitative models of succession, trees are great forest ecosystem engineers. The strength of tree stand influences on habitat were tested in rather homogenous conditions where heterogeneity of site condition was not an important influence. We hypothesized that canopy composition affects total aboveground vascular herb layer biomass (THB) and species composition of herb layer plant biomass (SCHB) more significantly than primary soil fertility or slope exposure. The study was conducted in 227 randomly selected research plots in seven types of forest stands: pure with Alnus glutinosa, Betula pendula, Pinus sylvestris, Quercus petraea and Robinia pseudoacacia, and mixed with dominance of Acer pseudoplatanus or Betula pendula located on hilltop and northern, eastern, western, and southern slopes on a reclaimed, afforested post-mining spoil heap of the Bełchatów Brown Coal Mine (Poland). Generalized linear models (GLZ) showed that tree stand species were the best predictors of THB. Non-parametric variance tests showed significantly higher (nearly four times) THB under canopies of A. glutinosa, R. pseudoacacia, B. pendula and Q. petraea, compared to the lowest THB found under canopies of P. sylvestris and mixed with A. pseudoplatanus. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) showed that SCHB was significantly differentiated along gradients of light-nutrient herb layer species requirements. RDA and non-parametric variance tests showed that SCHB under canopies of A. glutinosa, R. pseudoacacia and mixed with A. pseudoplatanus had large shares of nitrophilous ruderal species (32%, 31% and 11%, respectively), whereas SCHB under B. pendula, Q. petraea, mixed with B. pendula and P. sylvestris were dominated by light-demanding meadow (49%, 51%, 51% and 36%, respectively) and Poaceae species. The results indicated the dominant role of tree stand composition in habitat-forming processes, and although primary site properties had minor importance, they were also modified by tree stand species. © 2018

AB  - Forest fragmentation threatens forest biodiversity and ecosystem function. One of the concerns relates to increases in edge effects, which among other things affects the forest microclimate that influences the distribution and behavior of species. In Alberta, Canada, boreal anthropogenic disturbances from in situ oil exploration are increasing forest fragmentation, especially in the form of exploratory well pads and seismic lines (i.e., linear forest clearings created during the exploration phase of oil extraction). Dissection of these forests by seismic lines has the potential to change local patterns in wind and light, and thus may alter forest communities. Although alterations of these abiotic conditions are likely, the magnitude of these changes is unknown, particularly the effects of changes in the width and orientation of linear disturbances. Here we investigated changes in light and wind on seismic lines compared to that of adjacent undisturbed forests and nearby cleared openings. Specifically, we examined how seismic line characteristics (i.e., line direction, line width, and adjacent canopy height) altered local responses in these abiotic conditions. Generalized Linear Mixed Effect models predicted a 2-fold increase in average light intensity and maximum wind speeds, and a 4-fold increase in average wind speeds on seismic lines compared to adjacent forests. These changes did not approach the conditions in large openings, which compared to forests had a 3-fold increase in average light intensity, a 16-fold increase in average wind speeds, and a 4-fold increase in maximum wind speeds. Line width and orientation interacted with adjacent forest height altering the abiotic environment with wider lines having a 3-fold increase on maximum wind speed. We conclude that even localized, narrow ( < 10-m wide) forest disturbances associated with oil sands exploration alter forest microclimatic conditions. Recent changes in practices that reduce line width as well as promoting tree regeneration, will minimize the environmental effects of these anthropogenic disturbances. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Tree-bark volume estimation is a multi-faceted problem and at the same time of vital importance in the area of forest resources management. This importance relies on the fact that it constitutes a key variable for accurately assessing timber quantities, while at the same time its use has been spread as a soil-covering product or as a soil fertilizer or as a substitutional medicinal product. Consequently, due to its substantial economic impact, the accurate prediction of the tree-bark volume is of utmost importance. In this study, we propose three bark volume prediction models for black alder trees (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn subsp. barbata (C.A. Mey.) Yalt.) each targeting a different creation source of the black alder forest. Hence, we used data from naturally regenerated, plantation and coppice stand types. 1334 stem analysis data were collected for three different stand types. Two different modeling techniques were used, the weighted nonlinear regression and the ε-support vector regression techniques. These two modeling approaches were selected due to the fact that the need to handle regression analysis problems (noise in the data, high variability and/or non-normal distributions) is essential. The state-of-the-art approach suggests the usage of machine learning techniques in an effort to build reliable and robust models able to deal with complex environmental problems. An overall illustration of the precision obtained by the constructed models was conducted by statistical criteria such as the root mean square error, the correlation coefficient, the Furnival's index of fit and the Akaike's information criterion. Although the estimation and prediction errors of the two different modeling techniques seem to be close in pure numbers, the ε-support vector regression models gave the most accurate results for all stand types as compared to the nonlinear regression. Based on the results obtained from this study, the constructed ε-support vector regression models for modeling tree-bark volume showed a great ability to generalize, and thus worth considering as an alternative to regression modeling that enables increasing our ability for successful forest management. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rapid assessment of forest regeneration using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is likely to decrease the cost of establishment surveys in a variety of resource industries. This research tests the feasibility of using UAVs to rapidly identify coniferous seedlings in replanted forest-harvest areas in Alberta, Canada. In developing our protocols, we gave special consideration to creating a workflow that could perform in an operational context, avoiding comprehensive wall-to-wall surveys and complex photogrammetric processing in favor of an efficient sampling-based approach, consumer-grade cameras, and straightforward image handling. Using simple spectral decision rules from a red, green, and blue (RGB) camera, we documented a seedling detection rate of 75.8 % (n = 149), on the basis of independent test data. While moderate imbalances between the omission and commission errors suggest that our workflow has a tendency to underestimate the seedling density in a harvest block, the plot-level associations with ground surveys were very high (Pearson's r = 0.98; n = 14). Our results were promising enough to suggest that UAVs can be used to detect coniferous seedlings in an operational capacity with standard RGB cameras alone, although our workflow relies on seasonal leaf-offwindows where seedlings are visible and spectrally distinct from their surroundings. In addition, the differential errors between the pine seedlings and spruce seedlings suggest that operational workflows could benefit from multiple decision rules designed to handle diversity in species and other sources of spectral variability. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI images from years 2015 and 2016, a 1:10,000 digital soil map and a large number of reference samples were used with a random forest machine learning implementation in GRASS GIS to construct a tree species map for the entire territory of Estonia (42,755 km 2 ). Class probabilities for seven main tree species, an extra class for other species and probability of the forest cover not conforming to the forest definition were assigned for each pixel. Validation of dominant species distribution by area showed very strong correlation at county level both in state forests (R 2 = 0.98) and in private forests (R 2 = 0.93). Validation of tree species composition using harvester measurement data from 2,045 regeneration felling areas showed also very strong correlation (R 2 = 0.75) with the measured values of the proportion of coniferous trees. There was some tendency to underestimate the proportion of more common species and overestimation was found for the species with smaller proportion in the mixture. The accuracy for the proportion of deciduous species that were present in a smaller number of reference observations was substantially smaller. Validation of the results by using data from 659 large sample plots from the database of the Estonian Network of Forest Research Plots and 3,002 small sample plots from the National Forest Inventory (NFI) data base confirmed the findings based on harvester data. The NFI data revealed also a decrease of estimation error with the increase of forest age. Cohen's kappa index of agreement for main species for NFI sample plots with main species proportion equal to or greater than 75% decreased from 0.69 to 0.66 when observations with forests younger than 20 years were included in the comparison. Overall, the constructed map provides valuable data about tree species composition for the forests where no up to date inventory data are available or for the projects that require continuous cover of tree species data of known quality over the entire Estonia. © 2018 Mait Lang et al.

AB  - Aim: Ecological restoration is critical for recovering biodiversity and ecosystem services, yet designing interventions to achieve particular outcomes remains fraught with challenges. In the extensive regions where non-native species are firmly established, it is unlikely that historical conditions can be fully reinstated. To what degree, and how rapidly, can human-dominated areas be shifted via restoration into regimes that benefit target species, communities or processes?. Location: We explore this question in a >20-year-old reforestation effort underway at Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge in montane Hawaii. This large-scale planting of Acacia koa trees is designed to secure populations of globally threatened bird species by transitioning the site rapidly from pasture to native forest. Methods: We surveyed all forest birds in multiple corridors of young planted trees, remnant corridors of mature trees along gulches and at sites within mature forest. Using a Bayesian hierarchical approach, we identified which factors (distance from forest, habitat type and surrounding tree cover) had the most important influence on native and exotic bird abundance in the reforestation area. Results: We found that 90% of native and exotic bird species responded quickly, occupying corridors of native trees approximately a decade after planting. However, native and exotic forest birds responded to markedly different characteristics of the reforested area. Native bird abundance was strongly predicted by proximity to mature forest and remnant corridors; conversely, exotic bird abundance was best predicted by overall tree cover throughout the area reforested. Main conclusions: Our results demonstrate that large-scale tree planting in corridors adjacent to mature forest can catalyse rapid recovery (both increased abundance and expanded distribution) of forest birds and that it is possible to design reforestation to benefit native species in novel ecosystems. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The Ganges Delta and Sundarbans comprise the largest continuous mangrove area in the world. These mangroves are subjected to high riverine and tidal dynamics, and the coastline irregularity is characterized by many north-to-south oriented rivers that may hamper dispersal of mangrove propagules. Whereas connectivity levels and resulting population genetic structure often can be explained by ocean currents, other factors may control estuarine-scale mangrove genetic patterns and limit gene flow even between sites in close geographic proximity. We investigated whether the complex estuarine coastline in the Ganges Delta and Sundarbans shaped the genetic structure of Avicennia officinalis populations across regions and rivers at various distances (ca. 1 to 265 km). Using nine microsatellite loci, 433 individuals from 14 populations revealed predominant outcrossing and a high level of genetic variation when compared to other Avicennia species. A moderate but significant level of differentiation was detected among populations (FST = 0.09), and a principal coordinate analysis clearly separated populations of the Chittagong coastline from the Sundarbans. An individual-based Bayesian analysis also indicated those two gene pools. Genetic distances across the whole region could best be explained by cumulative river width and geographical distance separating the populations. Within the Sundarban region, the low genetic differentiation of A. officinalis populations indicated a continuous distribution model with a smooth isolation-by-distance that gradually increased across large rivers shaping the genetic structure of A. officinalis in the Ganges Delta. These findings indicated that in addition to geographical distance, rivers might act as physical barriers, affect gene flow and shape genetic connectivity. This and detailed population genetic information should be incorporated into the ongoing afforestation or restoration strategies in and outside of the Sundarbans mangrove forest. © 2017, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.

AB  - This paper explores predictors of juvenile tree mortality in a newly planted cohort in Worcester, MA, following an episode of large-scale tree removal necessitated by an Asian Longhorned Beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis, ALB) eradication program. Trees are increasingly seen as important providers of ecosystem services for urban areas, including: climate moderation and thus reduction in heating/cooling costs; air and water filtration; carbon uptake and storage; storm water runoff control; and cultural and aesthetic values. Many cities have initiated tree planting programs to receive these benefits, typically seeking to complement existing urban forest. Conversely, Worcester's reforestation program was necessary to offset the loss of approximately 30,000 trees removed to eradicate the invasive pest ALB. Since then, more than 30,000 juvenile trees have been planted to offset the loss, creating the opportunity to study a highly dynamic urban forest. Tree planting effectiveness is contingent on high survivorship rates, particularly during the establishment phase during the first five years after planting. Using a large data set including biophysical and sociodemographic variables, this research uses Conditional Inference Trees (CIT), a machine learning technique, to explore predictors of mortality. The most important variables as determined by CIT were used to create a logistic regression to predict mortality. This analysis was run for all trees, and for several subsets of the sample based on tree type and season and year of planting, yielding twenty individual models. Results indicated that the following variables are important predictors of mortality during establishment, in descending order: adjacent home/building age, proportion renter occupancy, days since tree planted, tax parcel size, number of trees planted on property, and tax parcel value. Of these variables, proportion renter occupancy and days since tree planted were most frequently found to be significant in the logistic regression modeling. © 2018

AB  - In the dwindling natural mangrove today, mangrove reforestation projects are conducted worldwide to prevent further losses. Due to monoculture and the low survival rate of artificial mangroves, it is necessary to pay attention to mapping and monitoring them dynamically. Remote sensing techniques have been widely used to map mangrove forests due to their capacity for large-scale, accurate, efficient, and repetitive monitoring. This study evaluated the capability of a 0.5-m Pléiades-1 in classifying artificial mangrove species using both pixel-based and object-based classification schemes. For comparison, three machine learning algorithms-decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF)-were used as the classifiers in the pixel-based and object-based classification procedure. The results showed that both the pixel-based and object-based approaches could recognize the major discriminations between the four major artificial mangrove species. However, the object-based method had a better overall accuracy than the pixel-based method on average. For pixel-based image analysis, SVM produced the highest overall accuracy (79.63%); for object-based image analysis, RF could achieve the highest overall accuracy (82.40%), and it was also the best machine learning algorithm for classifying artificial mangroves. The patches produced by object-based image analysis approaches presented a more generalized appearance and could contiguously depict mangrove species communities. When the same machine learning algorithms were compared by McNemar's test, a statistically significant difference in overall classification accuracy between the pixel-based and object-based classifications only existed in the RF algorithm. Regarding species, monoculture and dominant mangrove species Sonneratia apetala group 1 (SA1) as well as partly mixed and regular shape mangrove species Hibiscus tiliaceus (HT) could well be identified. However, for complex and easily-confused mangrove species Sonneratia apetala group 2 (SA2) and other occasionally presented mangroves species (OT), only major distributions could be extracted, with an accuracy of about two-thirds. This study demonstrated that more than 80% of artificial mangroves species distribution could be mapped. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Jamaica experienced net deforestation during the period 2001–2010. Yet, the proximate causes of deforestation and the reasons why a forest transition might be absent, particularly at the local-level, which can explain national scale changes, have been little studied. Long-term changes in socio-economic and land cover data over 68-years, for the moist forest of the Cockpit Country, Jamaica, and predictors of land cover change, were assessed using generalized linear and non-linear regression models. These were used to determine if the classic theorized determinants of a forest transition were present at different spatial scales and to identify the proximate cause(s) of deforestation. Some theorized determinants were present (improvements in national and sub-national economic development, and a decline in agricultural production); however, rural/local scale population density and growth rates were stable. As such, pressure on the unprotected (non-reserves) marginal/agricultural lands in the Cockpit Country was not reduced and this prevented them from reverting to forest. Forest cover for the entire Cockpit Country and the non-reserves therefore fluctuated significantly over time (nonlinear trend), peaking twice (1980 and 2002). The implementation of trade liberalization policies in the 1980s resulted in increased yam cultivation, which was the proximate cause of forest cover change in the non-reserves (a significant non-linear relationship). As a result, deforestation increased significantly during this period and again during the 2000s, at which time it was driven largely by other factors. A forest transition is unlikely to occur via an economic pathway, but it can possibly be achieved via the enforcement of existing forest protection laws and active promotion of forest cover expansion. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Changes in forest structure that result from silviculture, including timber harvest, can positively or negatively affect bird species that use forests. Because many bird species associated with mature forests are facing population declines, managers need to know how timber harvesting affects species of birds that rely on mature trees or forests for breeding, foraging, and other purposes. We used generalized linear mixed models to determine effects of clearcutting, shelterwood, single-tree selection, and group selection on detection of 18 species of bird associated with mature forests in the Ouachita Mountains of Oklahoma and Arkansas. We surveyed birds for 16 years after harvest. Most species (67%) responded positively to partial harvest that retained some overstory. Less intensive harvests had positive effects on more species and negative effects on fewer species than more intensive harvests, but responses to different treatments varied among species. Five species showed a significant positive response to the most intensive harvest (clearcuts), whereas 2 species showed a negative response. For the second most-intensive harvest (shelterwoods), 7 species showed a significant positive response and 1 species showed a negative response. For the less-intensive harvests, 9 species showed a positive response and no species had negative responses to single-tree selection, whereas 7 species had positive and no species showed negative responses to group selection. Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) and scarlet tanager (Piranga olivacea) responded negatively to all timber harvests; ovenbird appeared to be particularly susceptible to timber harvest, especially more intensive harvests such as clearcut and shelterwood. A variety of regeneration methods, including some more intensive treatments, along with maintenance of mature forest stands that retain well-developed midstories can be used to maintain the full suite of forest birds. © 2017

AB  - Reforestation with native species determines that autochthonous populations and plantations are often within the reach of gene flow. To address efficient strategies for forest plantation management it is fundamental to track the origin of reforestation material, in order to limit potentially detrimental effects on the adaptive potential of autochthonous populations. The use of genetic information to determine the origin of plantations is very effective when historical data about reforestation programs are absent. The main objectives of our study were to assess the origin of silver fir plantations in the Majella National Park (Central Apennines) and to compare genetic diversity parameters between plantations and natural stands. The latter objective is particularly relevant to evaluate the levels of genetic variation in plantations of local origin and to evaluate their suitability as already established reforestation stands. A comprehensive genetic dataset (1619 individuals from 33 natural silver fir populations genotyped at 16 nuclear microsatellite markers) was built to characterize potential seed sources for 10 plantations from the Majella National Park. Their genetic origin was assessed through combining the results of Bayesian assignment tests and analyses of genetic differentiation. Based on the genetic structure characterizing natural populations, we were able to definitely assess the origin of most of the planted individuals. Five plantations were established using material which most likely originated in natural populations that are only 10–20 km distant. These plantations harbour levels of genetic variation similar to the surrounding natural populations and are, therefore, to be considered valuable local forest genetic resources. The other five plantations consist either partially or entirely of allochthonous individuals which are similar to Alpine and northern Apennine populations. To avoid exotic gene flow to nearby autochthonous populations, we suggest the removal of plantations in which allochthonous individuals are present before they reach sexual maturity. However, before taking such action, we recommend the monitoring of the relative performance of different provenances, i.e. plantations entirely made by either putatively autochthonous or undoubtedly allochthonous material. Such an investigation would allow a thorough ex post evaluation of past reforestation programs. To conclude, our results show that genetic data can provide essential information for general decision-making in forest plantations management and, considering the thorough characterization of silver fir genetic structure in this multi-refugial area, such information can be particularly useful for a correct management of Apennine plantations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The species Plathymenia reticulata Benth., has great ecological potential being used for the reforestation of degraded areas, and the high economic value due to its wood of excellent quality. A technique to provide subsidies for conservation and management programs in this species, besides the use for studies of genetic diversity is the selection of molecular markers. Thus, the purpose of this study was the selection of primers ISSR (Inter Simple Sequence Repeat) to determine the genetic structure, as well as quantification of genetic diversity in a natural population of P. reticulata providing data for conservation and reforestation studies. The sample comprised 15 individuals in a forest fragment in the municipality of Guaçuí/ES, Brazil. Five primers were selected, which generated a total of 85 bands, of which 56 were polymorphic. It found high genetic diversity based on the values of Nei's diversity index (H' = 0.383) and Shannon index (I = 0.550). The number of genetic clusters obtained in the dendrogram by UPGMA corroborated with Bayesian's analysis revealed two groups. ISSR were efficient and have identified the genetic diversity in the population sampled. © 2018 Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fagus crenata Blume is an important forestry tree species that plays a key biological role in natural forests. Because F. crenata forests are declining under global warming, the conservation of seed resources is necessary to maintain sustainable regeneration. We examined the capability of seed cryopreservation to achieve semi-permanent preservation of the F. crenata genetic resource. Seeds at 7%-26% moisture content (MC) exhibited greater than 64% viability, with developing radicles growing at 22 °C in 16 h photoperiods following chilling at 2 °C for 2 months. These seeds were then stored cryogenically at -170 °C for 6 months; cryopreservation at 26% MC reduced seed viability to 12%, whereas dry seeds (7%-14% MC) maintained viability and were comparable with seeds that had neither been dried nor cryopreserved. Drying seeds to 6% MC reduced viability to 47%; following cryopreservation, the viability of these seeds with such a lowMCwas 36%. Using a Bayesian model, we then determined that the optimal range of MC for the cryopreservation of F. crenata seeds was 9%-12%. We conclude that cryopreservation is feasible for the long-term storage of F. crenata seeds, drying of the seeds to the range of optimal MC retains high viability during cryogenic storage. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing.

AB  - During the past decades, overuse of land resources has increasingly contributed to environmental crises in China. To mitigate wide-spread land degradation, actions have been taken to maintain and restore ecologically valuable landscapes such as natural forests. However, the effects of the various vegetation protection policies that have been implemented in China since the late 1990′s still remain largely unknown. In this paper, we therefore focus on mapping land use and land cover change (LULCC) in Inner Mongolia, one of the key regions targeted by Chinese ecological restoration programs. We used 250-m MODIS time series and a random forest classification approach to generate annual probabilities for each land cover class between 2000 and 2014. We then applied a trajectory-based change detection approach based on a modified version of the Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery (LandTrendr) algorithm to the probability time series and mapped land cover change trajectories. We found that our trajectory-based approach achieved high accuracies (overall accuracy 0.95 ± 0.02). It provides spatial-temporal land change maps that allow a land-use related interpretation of change patterns. Our change maps show that i) forest loss decreased rapidly after 2000 (from 15,717 ± 1770 ha in 2001 to 1313 ± 165 ha in 2014) and forest gain (190,645 ± 28,352 ha during 2001–2014) occurred in the ecological program zones, leading to a net forest increase in Inner Mongolia, and ii) cropland retirement (212,979 ± 54,939 ha during 2001–2014) mostly occurred at the early stage of ecological programs and mainly concentrated in drier environments and steep terrain. Overall, land cover mapping and trajectory-based land use analyses allowed a consistent characterization of LULCC over large areas, which is crucial for gaining a better understanding of environmental changes in the light of rapidly changing environmental policies and governance regimes in China. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The ground truth data sets required to train supervised classifiers are usually collected as to maximize the number of samples under time, budget and accessibility constraints. Yet, the performance of machine learning classifiers is, among other factors, sensitive to the class proportions of the training set. In this letter, the joint effect of the number of calibration samples and the class proportions on the accuracy was systematically quantified using two state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers (random forests and support vector machines). The analysis was applied in the context of binary cropland classification and focused on two contrasted agricultural landscapes. Results showed that the classifiers were more sensitive to class proportions than to sample size, though sample size had to reach 2,000 pixels before its effect leveled off. Optimal accuracies were obtained when the training class proportions were close to those actually observed on the ground. Then, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was implemented to artificially regenerate the native class proportions in the training set. This resampling method led to an increase of the accuracy of up to 30%. These results have direct implications for (i) informing data collection strategies and (ii) optimizing classification accuracy. Though derived for cropland mapping, the recommendations are generic to the problem of binary classification. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Interest in coppices is growing due to the need to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. In Italy, beech covers one million hectares, half of which originated by coppicing. This study tested which factors drive the presence and growth of beech resprouts, with a focus on fertility, cutting intensity, age, and size at time of coppicing. We analyzed 509 stools in 24 stands coppiced between 1 and 26 years before sampling. We fitted Generalized Linear Mixed Models of the probability of sprouting and height of the tallest resprout for each stool as a function of elevation, slope, aspect, bedrock, precipitation, temperature, age at coppicing, time since coppicing, residual shoot density, the sum, average and coefficient of variation of the diameter of cut shoots, and type of stool treatment. Of all harvested stools, 249 (49%) had sprouted with an average of 7.6 resprouts per stool. Height of the tallest resprout on each stool ranged from 3 to 800 cm, mainly as a function of time since coppicing. Resprout mortality was on average 1.4% per plot. Sprouting decreased with decreasing site fertility, increasing precipitation, and increasing size of cut stems. Leaving one or more shoots on the stool after felling produced a high proportion of sprouting stools (82%). Although based on a limited sample, our quantitative analysis of the driving factors of sprouting in beech can be used to support silvicultural decisions in over-mature beech coppices, and to optimize trade-offs between ecosystem services such as biomass production, biodiversity, and hydro-geologic protection. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Evaluating the environmental factors that affect seedling regeneration on deadwood is important for predicting the forest recovery process after dieback events. Pine wilt disease (PWD) has killed many adult trees of Pinus densiflora in recent decades and consequently created a huge accumulation of deadwood in lowland forests in Japan. These deadwoods are now providing nice seedbeds for variety of tree species including Cryptomeria japonica, which is the most important timber species in Japan. In the present study, we tested the effects of various factors on Cryptomeria seedlings growing on decayed Pinus logs in Japan. In total, 126 individuals of Cryptomeria seedlings (height <50 cm) colonizing on 22 pine logs were investigated. During a 5-month research period from May to October 2015, the survival rate of the seedlings was 87.3%, and the maximum height growth was 32.0 cm. Analysis using generalized linear mixed models revealed that delignified white-rot wood in the sapwood of the logs negatively affected seedling survival and growth. These results suggest that type of wood decay, reflecting fungal wood decomposer activity, would strongly affect survival and growth of Cryptomeria seedlings, although logs were important microsites for their establishment after pine wilt disease. © 2017 The Japanese Forest Society.

AB  - Two machine learning approach (i.e. Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF-NN) and Random Forest (RF) was developed and evaluated against a quadratic response surface model to predict the maximum removal efficiency of brilliant green (BG) from aqueous media in relation to BG concentration (4–20 mg L−1), sonication time (2–6 min) and ZnS-NP-AC mass (0.010–0.030 g) by ultrasound-assisted. All three (i.e. RBF network, RF and polynomial) model were compared against the experimental data using four statistical indices namely, coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and absolute average deviation (AAD). Graphical plots were also used for model comparison. The obtained results using RBF network and RF exhibit a better performance in comparison to classical statistical model for both dyes. The significant factors were optimized using desirability function approach (DFA) combined central composite design (CCD) and genetic algorithm (GA) approach. The obtained optimal point was located in the valid region and the experimental confirmation tests were conducted showing a good accordance between the predicted optimal points and the experimental data. The properties of ZnS-NPs-AC were identified by X-ray diffraction; field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy. Various isotherm models for fitting the experimental equilibrium data were studied and Langmuir model was chosen as an efficient model. Various kinetic models for analysis of experimental adsorption data were studied and pseudo second order model was chosen as an efficient model. Moreover, ZnS nanoparticles loaded on activated carbon efficiently were regenerated using methanol and after five cycles the removal percentage do not change significantly. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The relationship between land use structures and occurrence of the scrub typhus agent, Orientia tsutsugamushi, in small wild mammals was investigated in three provinces of Thailand: Buriram, Loei, and Nan. O. tsutsugamushi detection was performed using 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) amplicon sequencing approach using Miseq Illumina platform. In total, 387 animals (rodents and shrews) were examined for the infection. The 16S rDNA sequences of the bacterium were found in nine animals, namely Bandicota savilei, Berylmys bowersi, Leopoldamys edwardsi, Rattus exulans, R. tanezumi, and Rattus sp. phylogenetic clade 3, yielding 2.3% infection rate, with two new rodent species found infected by the bacterium in Thailand: B. bowersi and L. edwardsi. Using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) and Random Forest analyses for investigating the association between human-land use and occurrence of the bacterium, forest habitat appeared as a strong explicative variable of rodent infection, meaning that O. tsutsugamushi-infected animals were more likely found in forest-covered habitats. In terms of public health implementation, our results suggest that heterogenous forested areas including forest-converted agricultural land, reforestation areas, or fallows, are potential habitats for O. tsutsugamushi transmission. Further understanding of population dynamics of the vectors and their hosts in these habitats could be beneficial for the prevention of this neglected zoonotic disease. © 2017 by the authors

AB  - European larch is a dominant species in the subalpine belt of the western Alps. Despite recent increases in wildfire activity in this region, fire ecology of European larch is poorly understood compared to other larch species around the world. This study aims to assess whether European larch forests are resilient to fires, and to find out the factors that drive such resilience. We assessed the recovery of larch forests along a gradient of fire severity (low, moderate, high) based on the abundance and dominance of post-fire larch regeneration. We established 200 plots distributed among burned larch forests in nine wildfires that occurred between 1973 and 2007 in the western Alps. We included variables regarding topography, climate, fire severity, fire legacies, ground cover, grazing intensity, and time since fire. To evaluate potential drivers of larch recruitment, we applied generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and random forests (RF). Larch regeneration was much more abundant and dominant in the moderate- and high-severity fire classes than in the low-severity class. More than half of the plots in the moderate- and high-severity classes were classified as resilient, i.e., post-fire larch regeneration was enough to recover a larch stand. GLMM and RF produced complementary results: fire severity and legacies, such as snags, canopy cover and distance to seed source, were crucial factors explaining post-fire larch recruitment. This study shows that fire has a positive effect on larch regeneration, and we conclude that European larch forests are highly resilient to mixed-severity fires in the western Alps. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are declining across many regions in the Northern Hemisphere, leading to a need for management actions that will protect and enhance their habitats. In the Sierra Nevada of California, USA, montane chaparral is prevalent across the landscape, particularly after forest fires, and may provide important floral resources for pollinators. However post-fire montane chaparral is often targeted for removal during reforestation efforts, to reduce competition with young trees. In 2015 and 2016, we conducted non-lethal bumble bee surveys within 2 areas in the Sierra Nevada that burned in forest fires in 2004. Our goals were to describe bumble bee abundance and species richness in a post-fire landscape, to compare results from chaparral-dominated upland vegetation with results from interspersed patches of riparian vegetation, and to identify characteristics of individual chaparral stands that might make some stands more valuable to bumble bees than others. We captured 2,494 bumble bees of 12 species, and used Bayesian hierarchical modeling to determine that bumble bee abundance was substantially greater in riparian plots (modeled capture rate (Formula presented.) = 1.10 ± 0.31 [SD] bees/survey in 2015, and 2.96 ± 0.83 bees/survey in 2016) than in upland plots ((Formula presented.) = 0.47 ± 0.07 bees/survey in 2015, and 1.27 ± 0.18 bees/survey in 2016), which comprised a mix of chaparral shrubs and associated herbaceous plants. Modeled species richness was also greater in riparian plots, with an average mean richness of 4.1 ± 1.8 bumble bee species in riparian plots versus 2.3 ± 1.3 species in upland plots across the 2 years of the study. Within upland and riparian areas, plots dominated by herbaceous vegetation had greater abundance and species richness. One chaparral shrub species, bearclover (Chamaebatia foliolosa), was foraged on preferentially over all other shrub species and over all but 1 forb taxon, and was associated with increased occupancy probability in the Vosnesensky bumble bee (Bombus vosnesenskii), the most abundant bumble bee species on our study plots. A complex of closely related herbaceous species in the genus Phacelia, commonly associated with upland chaparral in our study area, was the plant taxon most frequently used by bumble bees, and appeared to be particularly important during mid-summer after bearclover flowers became scarce. Our findings suggest that post-fire chaparral communities are generally less intensively used by bumble bees than nearby riparian vegetation but may nevertheless provide important habitat. When chaparral removal is part of post-fire forest regeneration strategies, bumble bees will likely benefit from retention of a mosaic of upland habitat patches dominated by herbaceous vegetation and, in our study area, bearclover, which may provide foraging resources throughout the life cycle of local bumble bee colonies. Because habitat characteristics affected the occupancy of individual bumble bee species differently, managers should consider foraging preferences of target bumble bee species when making land management decisions. © 2017 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017

AB  - During the last decades, contrasted trends in forest fires among countries around the Mediterranean basin have been observed. In the northern/western countries, Land Use-Land Cover (LULC) changes led to more hazardous landscapes, with consequent increases in fires. This contrasted with fire trends in southern/eastern countries. The recent incidence of large fires in some of the latter prompted the question of whether they are now following the path of their neighbors decades earlier. In this study, we investigated recent LULC changes in southwestern Turkey, focusing on those that could affect fire, and the factors driving them. To this end, LULC maps at different time steps (1975, 1990, 2000 and 2010) were obtained from Landsat images, together with relevant socioeconomic data. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were applied to assess the effects of socioeconomic and geophysical factors on the dominant LULC changes over time. Over the whole period studied, the most important LULC changes were deforestation followed by afforestation. Deforestation was positively related to high livestock density and proximity to villages and increased forest interfaces with other LULC types. We found no evidence that LULC changes were making the landscape more hazardous as there was a net decrease in fuels biomass and the landscape became more fragmented over time. However, despite the area being heavily used and relatively fragmented, large fires can occur driven by severe weather. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Secondary forests play an important role in restoring carbon and biodiversity lost previously through deforestation and degradation and yet there is little information available on the extent of different successional stages. Such knowledge is particularly needed in tropical regions where past and current disturbance rates have been high but regeneration is rapid. Focusing on three areas in the Brazilian Amazon (Manaus, Santarém, Machadinho d'Oeste), this study aimed to evaluate the use of single-date Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data in the 2007–2010 period for i) discriminating mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest, and ii) retrieving the age of secondary forests (ASF), with 100 m × 100 m training areas obtained by the analysis of an extensive time-series of Landsat sensor data over the three sites. A machine learning algorithm (random forests) was used in combination with ALOS PALSAR backscatter intensity at HH and HV polarizations and Landsat 5 TM surface reflectance in the visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared spectral regions. Overall accuracy when discriminating mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest is high (95–96%), with the highest errors in the secondary forest class (omission and commission errors in the range 4–6% and 12–20% respectively) because of misclassification as mature forest. Root mean square error (RMSE) and bias when retrieving ASF ranged between 4.3–4.7 years (relative RMSE = 25.5–32.0%) and 0.04–0.08 years respectively. On average, unbiased ASF estimates can be obtained using the method proposed here (Wilcoxon test, p-value > 0.05). However, the bias decomposition by 5-year interval ASF classes showed that most age estimates are biased, with consistent overestimation in secondary forests up to 10–15 years of age and underestimation in secondary forests of at least 20 years of age. Comparison with the classification results obtained from the analysis of extensive time-series of Landsat sensor data showed a good agreement, with Pearson's coefficient of correlation (R) of the proportion of mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest at 1-km grid cells ranging between 0.97–0.98, 0.96–0.98 and 0.84–0.90 in the 2007–2010 period, respectively. The agreement was lower (R = 0.82–0.85) when using the same dataset to compare the ability of ALOS PALSAR and Landsat 5 TM data to retrieve ASF. This was also dependent on the study area, especially when considering mapping secondary forest and retrieving ASF, with Manaus displaying better agreement when compared to the results at Santarém and Machadinho d'Oeste. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Forests in Europe are threatened by increased diversity of Phytophthora species, but effects on trees of simultaneous infections by Phytophthora and ecological consequences of their coexistence are unknown. This study explored variation in early survival of Quercus ilex to Phytophthora infections and assessed interactions between Phytophthora species when trees were co-infected. Three Phytophthora species (P. cinnamomi, P. gonapodyides and P. quercina), seeds from 16 populations of Q. ilex (ballota and ilex subspecies) and two infection times were used as sources of variation in two experiments. The influence of Phytophthora species, Q. ilex subspecies and populations on plant germination and survival were analysed using generalized linear mixed models and survival analysis techniques. Germination rates were not influenced by Phytophthora spp. (P = 0.194) but by the subspecies and populations of Q. ilex (P < 0.001). In Phytophthora-infested soils, Q. ilex subsp. ilex germinated at higher rates than Q. ilex subsp. ballota. Plant survival was strongly influenced by Phytophthora species (P < 0.001), not by the subspecies and populations of Q. ilex. Seedling mortality was reduced and delayed if a less virulent Phytophthora species infected plants prior to infection by a more virulent Phytophthora species. The results help to explain oak decline syndrome and the lack of natural and artificial regeneration of Q. ilex forests. Lack of interspecific variability of early survival to Phytophthora spp. discourages direct sowing for artificial reforestation programmes. Large, thick seeds, giving plants rapid growth, are advantageous traits when soils are infested with Phytophthora spp. © 2016 British Society for Plant Pathology

AB  - Anthropogenic activities have accelerated habitat change, loss, and fragmentation, threatening biodiversity over large portions of the tropics. The resulting anthropogenically created landscape mosaics often include forests of different successional stages or that have experienced different levels of anthropogenic use, which affect the physical structure of the forest (e.g., forest height, vertical complexity of vegetation). These physical characteristics of forests may affect the abundance and biodiversity of forest inhabitants, and obscure effects of landscape changes (e.g., percent forest cover) on animal species. Because bats are ecologically diverse and include seed dispersers, pollinators, and top predators, they contribute to the structure and function of forests, and directly affect forest integrity and regeneration. Thus, understanding how variation in the vegetative structure of forests affects the abundance and biodiversity of bats may provide important information to effectively manage and conserve forest fragments. We surveyed bats at 24 sites in the southern Brazilian Amazon, and quantified vegetation structure (density, height, and basal area of trees, density of understory, and canopy openness). Using generalized linear mixed-effects models, we tested simple relationships of each structural characteristic with community- (taxonomic and phylogenetic dimensions of biodiversity), guild-, and population-level attributes of bats. Models for total abundance, taxonomic biodiversity (species diversity and dominance), and phylogenetic diversity were significant, increasing with tree height and basal area, and decreasing with canopy openness. At the population level, abundances of frugivores (Carollia perspicillata, Rhinophylla pumilio, Artibeus planirostris, A. obscurus, A. lituratus, Uroderma bilobatum) and nectarivores (Lonchopylla thomasi, Glossophaga soricina) were related significantly to vegetation structure. Abundances of some understory frugivores exhibited negative relationships with tree height, choosing younger forests, whereas abundances of canopy frugivores were highest in closed canopy forests. Of the nectarivores, L. thomasi was more abundant in older forests (negative relationship with density of trees), whereas G. soricina was more abundant in areas with low canopies and low basal area (i.e., earlier successional forest). Consequently, effective management of forest fragments should include consideration of local forest age and vegetation structure, as well as forest connectivity and patch size. In general, protecting areas with large trees and closed canopies enhances the persistence of pollinators and seed dispersers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The study tested the hypothesis that future changes in the composition of tree communities, as predicted by species distribution models, could already be apparent in the current regeneration patterns of three pine species (Pinus pinaster, P. nigra and P. sylvestris)inhabiting the central-eastern mountains of Spain. We carried out both an observational study and a seed-sowing experiment to analyze, along an altitudinal and latitudinal gradient, whether recent recruitment patterns indicate an expansion of P. pinaster forests to the detriment of P. nigra ones in the low-altitude southern sites of these mountains; or whether P. sylvestris is being replaced by P. nigra in the high-altitude sites from the same area. The observational study gathered data from 561 plots of the Spanish National Forest Inventory. The seed-sowing experiment tested the effects of irrigation and stand basal area on seedling emergence and survival. Data were analyzed by means of Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Regeneration of the three pine species responded similarly to the explicative factors studied, but the density of tree seedlings and saplings exhibited a wide spatial heterogeneity. This result suggested that a mosaic of site- and species-specific responses to climate change might mislead model projections on the future forest occupancy of tree species. Yet, we found no indications of neither an expansion nor a contraction of the near future forest occupancy of the tree species studied. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we evaluated how seedling survival and growth of Podocarpus glomeratus, a native tree vulnerable to extinction, varied across different altitudes and microsites. As part of a four-year reforestation program, 150 seedlings were planted in 15 experimental plots along an altitudinal gradient of five levels (2747, 3005, 3300, 3590 and 3850 m a.s.l.) and three repetitions by altitude (nested plots) in a grassland ecosystems from the community of Pajchanti (Cochabamba, Bolivia). Plant survival, growth and microsite around each seedling, such as slope and ground cover (rock outcrops, grasses, shrubs, mosses and herbs) were measured three times during the reforestation program. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and Tukey tests were used in order to evaluate the influence of altitude on seedling survival and growth (including nested plots as random factor). The influence of each component biotic or abiotic in the microsites on the survival and growth was analyzed also with GLMM, for each altitude separately. Thus, we avoided confusing effect of altitude and microsite. Seedlings survival was significantly greater at the intermediate altitude and lower at both altitudinal extremes, but seedlings growth was greater at the lower altitude range (from 2700 to 3300 m a.s.l.), while smaller at higher altitudes. Seedlings survival was not influenced by abiotic or biotic components of the microsite. However, high shrub cover was related to higher seedlings growth at the lowest altitude. High rock outcrops cover had a negative effect on growth in the intermediate altitude, while more rock outcrops and higher slope percentage had positive effect on the growth at a higher altitude (3590 m a.s.l.). Reforestation of P. glomeratus in grassland ecosystems should be carried out at 2700 to 3300 m a.s.l. Nonetheless, shrubs, rock outcrops and slope of the microsite influenced the establishment of the seedlings, depending on cover percentage and interactions with the altitude. These microsite components must be managed in future reforestations. © 2017, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reforestation of agricultural lands is an important means of restoring land and sequestering carbon (C). At large scales, the labour and costs of direct measurement of ecosystem responses can be prohibitive, making the development of models valuable. Here, we develop a new sampling scenario-based modelling approach coupled with Bayesian model averaging to build predictive models for absolute values in mixed-species woody plantings and differences from their adjacent pasture, for litter stocks, soil C stocks and soil C:N ratios. Modelling scenarios of increasing data availability and effort were tested. These included variables that could be derived without a site visit (e.g. location, climate and management) that were sampled in the adjacent pasture (e.g. soil C and nutrients) or were sampled in the environmental planting (e.g. vegetation, litter properties, soil C and nutrients). The predictive power of models varied considerably among C variables (litter stocks, soil C stocks and soil C:N ratios in tree plantings and their differences to their adjacent pastures) and the model scenarios used. The use of a sampling scenario-based approach to building predictive models shows promise for monitoring changes in tree plantings, following reforestation. The approach could also be readily adapted to other contexts where sampling effort for predictor variables in models is a major potential limitation to model utilization. This study demonstrates the benefit of exploring scenarios of data availability during modelling and will be especially valuable where the sampling effort differs greatly among variables.

AB  - Cerulean Warbler (Setophaga cerulea) populations have undergone significant declines over the past four decades, and the species is considered state endangered in Indiana. These migratory songbirds nest in the canopies of mature deciduous forests throughout eastern North America, but local microhabitat preferences vary by geography and scale, and may influence differential nest success rates across the breeding range. Between 2010 and 2015, we searched for nests, mapped out male territories, and monitored nest success in the Hardwood Ecosystem Experiment in central Indiana. We collected data on a variety of microhabitat features at the territory, nest patch, and nest site levels, as well as at non-use points, and evaluated the influence of several characteristics on nest success. We evaluated nest patch and territory attributes using binomial generalized linear models and nest success with a generalized linear mixed-effects model. Cerulean Warblers selected nest patches characterized by taller trees and located on ridges and valleys rather than on mid-slopes, while males selected territories that were located on steeper northeast-facing slopes closer to roadways than random points. Successful nests were placed lower in the nest tree and were found in areas with shorter trees; several features selected by Cerulean Warblers at the nest patch and territory levels were associated with lower nest success rates. As elsewhere in the range, white oak was an important nest tree species. In developing forest management strategies, land managers must strive to balance small-scale microhabitat preferences with the need for regenerating oak-hickory forests to sustain Cerulean Warbler breeding populations. © 2016

AB  - Decomposition subsystems have an essential role in forest dynamics but few studies demonstrate the effect of microbial decay traits on seedling regeneration. In the present study, we focused on seedling regeneration on coarse woody material (CWM), which is an important regeneration site for forest tree species, and the effects of wood decay type according to fungal decay preference for wood structural components on seedling colonization. Effects of log properties including wood decay type and other environmental variables on seedling density were evaluated by ordination methods and generalized linear models. In total, 22 woody species were recorded as seedlings on Pinus densiflora logs. By ordination analysis, white rot in heartwood and brown rot in sapwood, as well as canopy openness and log diameter, showed significant association with seedling communities. The factors selected for a generalized linear model for explaining seedling densities of the two dominant seedling species Cryptomeria japonica and P. densiflora included brown rot in sapwood and white rot in heartwood, but the effects were different: a positive effect of brown rot on C. japonica and a negative effect of white rot on P. densiflora. These results suggested that wood decay type could induce niche separation between dominant tree species regenerating on CWM. © 2017, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - In West Africa, accurate classification of land cover and land change remains a big challenge due to the patchy and heterogeneous nature of the landscape. Limited data availability, human resources and technical capacities, further exacerbate the challenge. The result is a region that is among the more understudied areas in the world, which in turn has resulted in a lack of appropriate information required for sustainable natural resources management. The objective of this paper is to explore open source software and easy-to-implement approaches to mapping and estimation of land change that are transferrable to local institutions to increase capacity in the region, and to provide updated information on the regional land surface dynamics. To achieve these objectives, stable land cover and land change between 2001 and 2013 in the Kara River Basin in Togo and Benin were mapped by direct multitemporal classification of Landsat data by parameterization and evaluation of two machine-learning algorithms. Areas of land cover and change were estimated by application of an unbiased estimator to sample data following international guidelines. A prerequisite for all tools and methods was implementation in an open source environment, and adherence to international guidelines for reporting land surface activities. Findings include a recommendation of the Random Forests algorithm as implemented in Orfeo Toolbox, and a stratified estimation protocol − all executed in the QGIS graphical use interface. It was found that despite an estimated reforestation of 10,0727 ± 3480 ha (95% confidence interval), the combined rate of forest and savannah loss amounted to 56,271 ± 9405 ha (representing a 16% loss of the forestlands present in 2001), resulting in a rather sharp net loss of forestlands in the study area. These dynamics had not been estimated prior to this study, and the results will provide useful information for decision making pertaining to natural resources management, land management planning, and the implementation of the United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (UN-REDD). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The evaluation of the future dynamics of deforestation is essential to creating the basis for the effective implementation of REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) initiatives. Such evaluation is often a challenging task, especially for countries that have to cope with a critical lack of data and capacities, higher uncertainties, and competing interests. We present a new modeling approach that makes use of available and easily accessible data sources to predict the spatial location of future deforestation. This approach is based on the Random Forest algorithm, which is a machine learning technique that enables evidence-based, data-driven decisions and is therefore often used in decision-making processes. Our objective is to provide a straightforward modeling approach that, without requiring cost-intensive assessments, can be applied in the early stages of REDD+, for a stepwise implementation approach of REDD+ projects in regions with limited availability of data, capital, technical infrastructure, or human capacities. The presented model focuses on building business-as-usual scenarios to identify and rank potentially suitable areas for REDD+ interventions. For validation purposes we applied the model to data from Nicaragua. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Remotely sensed data have revealed ongoing reforestation across many tropical landscapes. However, most studies have quantified changes between discrete land cover categories that are difficult to relate to the continuous changes in forest structure that underlie reforestation. Here, we demonstrate how generalized linear models (GLMs) can predict tree height and tree canopy cover from Landsat satellite reflectance in a 109 882 ha tropical agricultural landscape of western Panama. We derived tree canopy cover and tree height from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, and related these variables to the fraction of photosynthetic vegetation (PV) in Landsat pixels. We found large gains in predictive accuracy from modeling tree canopy height with a gamma GLM and tree canopy cover with a binomial GLM, relative to modeling these variables using linear regression. Adding social and environmental covariates to our GLMs, including topography and parcel membership (representing different land owners), increased predictive accuracy, resulting in best-fit models with an R2 of 55.68% and RMSE of 23.69% for tree canopy cover, and an R2 of 51.24% and RMSE of 3.42 m for tree height. Finally, we applied the GLMs to predict tree height and tree canopy cover in Landsat images from c. 2000 to 2012, and used results to quantify changes in forest structure during this 12-year period. We found that &gt;60% of pixels in our study area had increased in tree height and tree canopy cover, suggesting widespread forest regrowth. These increases were spatially widespread across the study area, yet subtle, with most pixels increasing &lt;2 m in tree height. Our results suggest ecological and agricultural changes that could be overlooked if measuring land cover change with discrete forest and non-forest categories. Overall, we show the advantages of linking LiDAR and Landsat data to quantify forest regrowth in an agricultural landscape. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - The increasing availability of aerial photographs and remote sensing images allows the forecasting of forest dynamics in response to land-use changes, such as the abandonment of rural activities. The cessation of these activities launches natural regeneration and demographic expansion of formerly fragmented and isolated forests. By tracking these changes over decades, we were able to identify the environmental factors that promote or hamper natural regeneration of forestlands disturbed for centuries. Here, we tracked the demographic expansion of Juniperus turbinata ssp. canariensis over a study period spanning six decades based on aerial pictures. We applied Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) analyses to identify hotspots and coldspots of regeneration and we further quantified the role of ecological and anthropogenic factors in driving natural regeneration by applying a generalized lineal model. Aerial photos showed a clear demographic forest expansion during the approximately 60 years spanned by this study. LISA revealed that this regeneration was not homogeneous across the landscape; rather it was highly aggregated around an increasing number of hotspots of natural regeneration during the study period. The initial density of juniper individuals was the most important variable underpinning the demographic expansion followed by aspect, elevation, and distance to anthropic areas. According to our results, island juniper woodlands regenerate steadily in areas affected by moderate levels of anthropogenic disturbances. Our results provide highly valuable information to implement forest management plans. On-going and future conservation plans to recover the thermophilous Macaronesian forest will particularly benefit from this type of study. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Extensive knowledge of the ecological and genetic consequences of implementing management practices (i.e. logging) in natural ecosystems is of fundamental importance to conservation action. Accordingly, characterization of forest genetic resources in managed vs non-managed stands may inform management decisions to ensure the long-term persistence of genetic diversity. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of management practices on the genetic diversity and spatial genetic structure of contrasting forests, through an age-class sampling design and the use of microsatellite markers. We evaluated the impact of logging in three populations of Nothofagus pumilio, a dominant tree species in Patagonian temperate forests, by comparing managed and non-managed stands in each population. Selective extraction of best-featured individuals, i.e. those with forestry aptitude, such as higher trees with straight trunks and good sanitary conditions, was performed between 1990 and 2004. One of the studied sites was located in a state-protected area while the others were on private land affected by grazing. At each managed stand over-mature trees (MF-O), adult remnant trees (MF-A) and seedlings representing forest regeneration (MF-R) after silvicultural management were sampled. In non-managed stands age classes were restricted to adults (CF-A) and seedlings (CF-R). A minimum of 30 individuals per age class were collected, totalling 454 samples which were genotyped at six microsatellite loci. Non-significant differences in genetic diversity were found between managed and natural woods in all populations. A trend towards decreasing frequencies or even allele loss among remnant adults of logged stands can however be interpreted as a sign of impact, probably a consequence of genetic drift. Each site showed particular, different outcomes with respect to genetic structure. While in Pop 1 (Huemules, 42°S) significant genetic differentiation was found between management treatments, admixture of genetic clusters (Bayesian clustering and DAPC analysis) occurred in Pop 2 (Guacho Lake, 43°S) and no genetic structure was found in Pop 3 (Engaño Lake, 43°S). Post-harvest genetic contact between contrasting stands is likely. A Landscape Interpolation Analysis showed clusters of individuals (shared genotypes) spatially restricted for managed stands (significant in Pop 3), whereas a random spatial distribution characterized control forests. Therefore, it is possible that management affected and disrupted the genetic structure. The different genetic patterns revealed for each population call for site-by-site interpretation. Differential intensity and frequency of management practices, presence/absence of livestock in the forest, and evolutionary history may all have had combined effect on current genetic diversity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To assess the impacts of a low-intensity selective timber harvest on a palm community in Belize, we mapped logging infrastructure (i.e., roads, log landings, skid trails, and stumps) and measured palm regeneration 1 year after a timber harvest carried out using reduced-impact logging (RIL) practices. We sampled palms across a gradient of increasing harvest impact severity from areas not directly affected by logging, in felling gaps, on secondary and primary skid trails, and on log landings. We used generalised linear mixed-effect models fitted in a Bayesian framework and applied a non-metric multi-dimensional scaling of the ecological distances between sites to evaluate differences in palm seedling regeneration density and species composition, respectively. The harvest of an average of 2.5 trees ha-1 caused 0.4% of the forest to be converted to log landings, 0.7% and 3.6% to roads and skid trails, and 2.3% to felling gaps, which left 93.0% of the 350 ha harvest block with no direct impacts of logging. The difference in abundance and species composition of palm regeneration in unlogged areas compared to felling gaps and skid trails was small, but log landings had markedly lower densities. These results highlight that the impacts of selective logging are minor at least where harvest intensities are low and RIL practices are employed. If further reductions in canopy opening and soil disturbance are desired, we recommend that logs be cable-yarded (i.e., winched) the final 20 m to skid trails instead of driving to the tree stumps. We estimate that implementation of this practice would reduce total skid trail coverage from 3.6% to 2.9% and overall forest disturbance from 7.0% to 6.3%. However, further reductions in disturbance might be inimical to the maintenance of palms and will certainly not favour regeneration of light-demanding commercial timber species (e.g., Swietenia macrophylla). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Long-term monitoring of ecosystem succession provides baseline data for conservation and management, as well as for understanding the dynamics of underlying biogeochemical processes. We examined the effects of deforestation and subsequent afforestation of a riparian forest of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) on stable isotope ratios of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) and natural abundances of radiocarbon (δ14C) in stream biota in the Mt. Gomadan Experimental Forest and the Wakayama Forest Research Station, Kyoto University, central Japan. Macroinvertebrates, periphytic algae attached to rock surfaces (periphyton), and leaf litter of terrestrial plants were collected from six headwater streams with similar climate, topography, and bedrock geology, except for the stand ages of riparian forests (from 3 to 49 yr old in five stands and >90 yr old in one reference stand). Light intensity and δ13C values of both periphyton and macroinvertebrates decreased synchronously with forest age in winter. A Bayesian mixing model indicates that periphyton contributions to the stream food webs are maximized in 23-yr-old forests. Except for grazers, most macroinvertebrates showed δ14C values similar to those of terrestrial leaf litter, reflecting the influence of modern atmospheric CO2 δ14C values. On the other hand, the δ14C values of both periphyton and grazers (i.e., aquatic primary consumers) were significantly lower than that of modern atmospheric CO2, and were lowest in 23-yr-old forest stands. Previous studies show that root biomass of C. japonica peaks at 15-30 yr after planting. These evidences suggest that soil CO2 released by root respiration and dispersed by groundwater weathers carbonate substrata, and that dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with low δ14C is incorporated into stream periphyton and some macroinvertebrates. The ecological response in the studied streams to clear-cutting and replanting of Japanese cedar is much slower (∼20 yr) than the chemical response (<5 yr). More than 50 yr is required for the food web structure to completely recover from clear-cutting. The ecological delay is attributed to several biogeochemical factors, the understanding of which is critical to integrated management of forest-stream continuum and the prediction of ecosystem resilience in response to environmental change. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - It is often highly desirable to know not only where species are likely to occur (i.e. occupancy) but also how many individuals are supported by a given habitat (i.e. density). For many animals, occupancy and density may be determined by distinct ecological processes. Here we develop a novel abundance model as the product of landscape-scale occupancy probability and habitat-scale density given occupancy. One can conceptualize our model as fully packing a landscape with home ranges or territories based on habitat quality, and then subtracting territories based on a probabilistic process that accounts for the fact that species rarely exhibit full occupancy across heterogeneous landscapes. The model is designed to predict abundance at fine spatial scales, using resolutions equal to or smaller than a single home range or territory. We demonstrate this model on the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), a species of management concern linked to post-fire forests. Occupancy is derived from a regional monitoring effort, while density given occupancy comes from a telemetry study of variation in territory size. A Bayesian framework is used to combine independent occupancy and home-range size models and predict abundance of Black-backed Woodpeckers at 4 fires that burned in 2012 or 2013. Predictions are evaluated with independently collected survey data, showing that the model is successful at predicting both absolute abundance at fires as well as relative abundance within and among fires. The conceptual model presents a promising new framework for fine-scale modelling of density and abundance for other territorial yet elusive species. Telemetry and occupancy data are widely collected for many species, but rarely utilized in combination, and the ecological exploration of the factors that determine occurrence versus home-range size may provide useful biological insight. As applied to the Black-backed Woodpecker, the model provides a tool for resource managers to explore trade-offs in retaining burned forest habitat versus managing for other post-fire goals, such as salvage logging or reforestation efforts that require snag removal. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The main objective of this study was to determine the influence of environmental heterogeneity on the regenerative component of an Alluvial Araucaria Forest in the southern Santa Catarina State plateau region. The regenerated individuals were sampled within 48 plots allocated in three sectors: river, interior and edge. The survey of environmental variables was conducted in all plots, obtaining data of edaphic variables, topography, groundwater level, canopy cover, environmental impact and soil classification. A Principal Component Analysis was performed for the surveyed variables to identify environmental gradients. For the regenerative component, the influence of environmental sectors, related to river distance and soil classes, on floristic-structural organization was determined by generalized linear models. The organization of vegetation was verified using Principal Coordinates Analysis. The presence of indicator species was evaluated for the sectors with significant effect on vegetation. Cambisols predominated in the area, and the terrain is mostly flat and the soils are dystrophic, acidic, alic and with sandy loam to silt loam texture. One third of the plots presented water near the surface, indicating greater environmental selectivity in these places. The canopy was predominantly closed (91.16%) and the level of environmental impact was considered low. The division into sectors, defined by to the river distance, had a significant influence on the distribution pattern of species, and the edge sector showed the most distinctive floristic and structural composition, with 14 indicator species. The regenerative component demonstrated spatial variations that reflected the environmental heterogeneity according to sectors, with river distance determinant for the formation of floristic groups.

AB  - The miombo woodland is the most extensive dry forest in the world, with the potential to store substantial amounts of biomass carbon. Efforts to obtain accurate estimates of carbon stocks in the miombo woodlands are limited by a general lack of biomass estimation models (BEMs). This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of most commonly employed allometric models for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) in miombo woodlands, and to develop new models that enable more accurate estimation of biomass in the miombo woodlands. A generalizable mixed-species allometric model was developed from 88 trees belonging to 33 species ranging in diameter at breast height (DBH) from 5 to 105 cm using Bayesian estimation. A power law model with DBH alone performed better than both a polynomial model with DBH and the square of DBH, and models including height and crown area as additional variables along with DBH. The accuracy of estimates from published models varied across different sites and trees of different diameter classes, and was lower than estimates from our model. The model developed in this study can be used to establish conservative carbon stocks required to determine avoided emissions in performance-based payment schemes, for example in afforestation and reforestation activities. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - In Quebec, reforestation by means of coniferous plantation began in the early 1980 and peaked in 1990. However, one wonders if these efforts bore fruits given the high degree of vegetation competition encountered in some plantations. The study objectives were to evaluate and compare changes in forest cover of coniferous plantations established since 1985 on clay soils in the boreal forest. The evaluation was conducted using vegetation indices extracted from images provided by Landsat TM and ETM + for the periods 2000, 2005 and 2010. Digital ortho-photos and field data were used to assess the effectiveness of these indices. The Tasseled Cap Greenness Index proved to be the most efficient to discriminate the type of cover with a Kappa index of 50[%]. The results show that over 50[%] of the plantations were classified as mixed (deciduous - softwood) and 25[%] were classified as deciduous in 2000, while in 2010, 51 [%] of plantations were mixed and 11 [%] deciduous. Using a generalized linear mixed model with Laplace approximation, we have established the relationship between changes in cover, age and type of the plantation. The likelihood of an initial deciduous cover to evolve toward a mixed or coniferous cover was nearly 68 [%]. The plantation type, its age and cover and their interactions all had significant effects on the probability of a cover to change over time. This project contributed to the assessment of coniferous plantations established between 1980 and 1995 over an area of 18797 ha and confirms that remote sensing tools are effective for tracking large areas while providing quality information for the planning of silvicultural treatments.

AB  - In the last decades, an increasing number of forest decline events and widespread tree mortality have been reported worldwide as a consequence of different global change drivers. Such a general decrease in tree health and cover has a large potential to impact mycorrhizal communities, but this issue remains largely unexplored.We used a Bayesian framework to analyze the impact of Quercus suber decline on spatial patterns of seedling-mycorrhiza interactions in mixed Mediterranean forests in Southern Spain, and evaluate the relative importance of this symbiosis as a driver of oak seedling establishment.Our models showed that the spatial variability found in the patterns of oak seedling colonization by both arbuscular mycorrhizas and ectomycorrhizas was partially linked to the process of Q. suber decline. Moreover, seedling survival and growth was influenced by the intensity of mycorrhizal colonization, but in quite unexpected ways. Arbuscular mycorrhizas had a larger effect on seedling performance than ectomycorrhizas, and the effects of both groups were negative or neutral but never positive.We conclude that because the spatial distribution of the seedling-mycorrhiza association responded to the identity and health status of individual trees, and mycorrhizal infection did in turn affect seedling performance, tree decline might affect forest dynamics through changes in plant-soil biota feedbacks. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The fire ecology of European beech (. Fagus sylvatica L.) is poorly understood. We analyzed beech recruitment after a mast year in recently burnt and unburnt stands to answer to the questions: (i) Does post-fire mast seed production and recruitment in beech depend on fire severity, and (ii) which are the processes by which fire and the environment affect beech seed production, germination and seedling emergence and establishment in the first year after masting?We selected three beech stands in the Southwestern Alps, burnt in either the winter of 2012 or 2013 but before the 2013 beech mast year. In the summer of 2013, at each stand, we established 30 sampling plots stratified by fire severity based on the percent basal area loss of beech (low; intermediate; high). Another 10 plots per stand were assigned to a control (unburnt) group. In the spring of 2014, we counted cupules, seeds, germinated seeds, and emergent seedlings (i.e., rooted in mineral soil) in four squares (0.4. ×. 0.4. m) at each plot. In the summer of 2014, at each plot, we measured stand characteristics (i.e., a circular area of 12-m in a planar radius) and counted established seedlings in 12 squares (1. ×. 1. m).Control stands had 448±38cupulesm-2 and 489±44seedsm-2 with a germination rate of 11%. In comparison to the control, production of cupules and seeds was significantly lower only under high fire severity (-75% and -63%, respectively). At intermediate and low severity sites, cupule and seed production were similar to unburnt sites, while seed germination and seedling emergence were higher. At intermediate severity sites established seedlings (86,000±10,574seedlingsha-1) were significantly more frequent than the control. Generalized linear and additive models demonstrated that intermediate disturbance of litter and canopy cover favored beech regeneration.Mixed severity fires are an important ecological factor for the natural regeneration of beech. Such insights in beech disturbance ecology can help improve silviculture and post-fire restoration of Alpine forests. The synergy between fire and masting raises new questions concerning the role of fire in temperate beech forests. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The selection of appropriate species in a reforestation project has always been a complex decision-making problem in which, due mostly to government policies and other stakeholders, not only economic criteria but also other environmental issues interact. Climate change has not usually been taken into account in traditional reforestation decision-making strategies and management procedures. Moreover, there is a lack of agreement on the percentage of each one of the species in reforestation planning, which is usually calculated in a discretionary way. In this context, an effective multicriteria technique has been developed in order to improve the process of selecting species for reforestation in the Mediterranean region of Spain. A hybrid Delphi-AHP methodology is proposed, which includes a consistency analysis in order to reduce random choices. As a result, this technique provides an optimal percentage distribution of the appropriate species to be used in reforestation planning. The highest values of the weight given for each subcriteria corresponded to FR (fire forest response) and PR (pests and diseases risk), because of the increasing importance of the impact of climate change in the forest. However, CB (conservation of biodiversitiy) was in the third position in line with the aim of reforestation. Therefore, the most suitable species were Quercus faginea (19.75%) and Quercus ilex (19.35%), which offer a good balance between all the factors affecting the success and viability of reforestation. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The limited supply of high quality planting materials for a wide species base is a major reason for the limited success of reforestation programmes or projects in many developing countries. This paper reports the research that was undertaken to improve the supply of high quality planting materials for agroforestry, tree farming and reforestation in the Philippines. A systems approach was used to identify mechanisms to improve the operational effectiveness of the forest nursery sector. A Bayesian Belief Network of the forest nursery sector was developed to examine the interactions between the key components of the forest nursery sector, identify key leverage points for intervention and explore potential impacts of possible policy interventions. Although improving the operational effectiveness of individual, communal and government nurseries will result in high operational effectiveness of the forest nursery sector, the operational effectiveness of government nurseries is likely to have a negative impact on the market for seedlings from smallholder nurseries i.e. individual and communal nurseries, thus impeding the sustainability of smallholder nurseries. Increasing the supply of high quality germplasm for a wide variety of species, improving the technical capabilities of smallholder nursery operators in seedling production and increasing the market demand of high quality seedlings from smallholder nurseries are the most important requirements for improving the operational effectiveness of the forest nursery sector. However, government nurseries can play a crucial role in improving the effectiveness of the forest nursery sector by diversifying their production to focus on species that are in demand by smallholder farmers and which cannot be supplied by individual or communal nurseries. Failing to do this will result in the current situation continuing in which government nursery sector competes with private and communal nurseries. © 2015.

AB  - In the present study, we investigated the genetic structure and diversity of P.nigra populations in Bulgaria, using simple sequence nuclear repeats. Among-population structure was studied with distance and Bayesian frequency methods, assuming geometric distance and a “non-admixture” model. The “NJ” and “non-admixture” clusters confirm the “mountain effect” hypothesis of the black pine genetic structure in the study region. The analyses showed moderate among-population divergence (13.31 %; AMOVA) and evidence of genetic bottlenecks. The coalescent analyses suggest that P. nigra has survived for a long period (thousands of generations) under strong selection pressure and that its populations continued to be exposed to stochastic factors like climate fluctuation, forest fire and disease. The combination of recent and historic changes is responsible for the present population size and genetic diversity. Our results suggest that conservation and management practices should strive to maintain this genetic differentiation, specifically by emphasising reforestation efforts with stocks from local provenances to avoid non-local introductions. © 2015, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

AB  - This paper evaluates the post-dispersal artificial seed predation rates in two areas of the southeastern Amazon forest-savanna boundary, central Brazil. We conducted the survey in a disturbance regime controlled research site to verify if exists an edge effect in these rates and if the disturbance (in this case annual fire and no fire) affects seed predation. We placed 800 peanuts seeds in each area at regular distance intervals from the fragment`s edge. Data were analyzed by a likelihood ratio model selection in generalized linear models (GLM). The complete model (with effects from edge distance and site and its interaction) was significative (F3=4.43; p=0.005). Seeds had a larger predation rates in fragment’s interior in both areas, but in the controlled area (no disturbance) this effect was less linear. This suggests an edge effect for post-dispersal seed predation, and that disturbances might alter these effects. Even if we exclude the site effect (grouping both areas together) there is still a strong edge effect on seed predation rates (F3=32.679; p&gt;0.001). We did not verify predator’s species in this study; however, the presence of several species of ants was extremely common in the seeds. The detection of an edge effect in only a short survey time suggests that there is heterogeneity in predation rates and that this variation might affect plant recruitment in fragmented areas of the Amazon forest. Henceforth, this seed predation should be taken in consideration in reforestation projects, where the main source of plants species is from seed distribution. © 2015, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

AB  - Reforestation has been widely adopted as a solution to multiple global change issues. However, the role of herbivory by invasive species in the restoration of grassland to forest has received little attention. We conducted a field experiment to investigate the impacts of a widespread invasive mammalian herbivore, the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), on trees planted in a landscape-scale reforestation program in south-eastern Australia. Three native tree species were planted inside and outside rabbit-proof exclosures within 10 experimental units, and a random half of the units were subjected to intensive and sustained rabbit control for the remainder of the experiment. Quarterly survival of trees, and total aboveground biomass at the conclusion of the experiment, were estimated using hierarchical Bayesian models. Control substantially reduced rabbit densities on the five treatment units relative to the five non-treatment units. Survival of trees planted outside exclosures was highest at lowest rabbit density and declined non-linearly with increasing rabbit density for all three tree species, but even very low rabbit densities had strong negative effects on the survival of trees outside exclosures. There was a three-way interaction between tree height, being outside an exclosure, and rabbit density. Smaller trees planted outside exclosures always had substantially lower overall survival than trees of the same height planted inside exclosures, and the magnitude of the difference increased with increasing rabbit density. Increasing rabbit densities reduced the overall survival of increasingly taller trees of all three species planted outside exclosures. The aboveground biomass of trees surviving outside exclosures was significantly greater in treatment units compared with non-treatment units for all three species. The combined effects of differential survival and accumulation of aboveground biomass led to higher biomasses inside exclosures relative to outside exclosures just 21 months after planting. The aboveground biomass of trees planted outside exclosures declined with increasing rabbit density, and was effectively zero when rabbit densities exceeded 100 active warren entrances/ha. These results demonstrate that invasive herbivores can rapidly arrest the conversion of grassland to forest. Invasive herbivores such as the European rabbit may need to be completely excluded in order to maximize the benefits of reforestation. © 2015 Forsyth et al.

AB  - We describe a surface cover change detection method based on the Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC). The AGDC is a common analytical framework for large volumes of regularly gridded geoscientific data initially developed by Geoscience Australia (GA), the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). AGDC effectively links geoscience data sets from various sources by spatial and temporal stamps associated with the data. Therefore, AGDC enables analysis of generations of consistent remote sensing time series data across Australia. The Australian Reflectance Grid 25m is one of the remote sensing data sets in the AGDC. The data is currently hosted on the high performance computational cloud at the National Computational Infrastructure. Our change detection method takes advantage of temporally rich data in the AGDC, applying time series analysis to identify changes in surface cover. The aim of this study is to develop a modelling framework addressing these issues, and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of data modelling processes for the AGDC. The framework adopts a modular design, taking advantages of standardisation of data structures provided by the AGDC. The basic unit in the framework is a modelling module, which applies generic statistical functions or machine learning algorithms on a spatial-temporal partition of remote sensing data. Under the framework, a typical workflow of a modelling process consists of a sequence of connected modules. Such modular design offers both flexibility and reusability. To detect change we apply a series of modules, which are independent of each other. The modules include: - a pixel quality mask and time series noise detection mask, which detects and filters out noise in data; - classification modules based on a random forests algorithm, which classifies pixels into specific objects using spectral information; - training modules, which create classification modules using known surface cover data; - time series analysis modules, which model and reduce time series data into coefficients relevant to change detection targets; - temporal and spatial classification modules, which classify pixels into predefined land cover classes. This paper summarises development of the work flow and the initial results from example applications, such as reforestation / deforestation detection and coastal zone mapping. © 2020 Proceedings - 21st International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2015.

AB  - From the late 1970's and early 1980's an evergreen species named Prosopis (mesquite) was introduced to countries worldwide due to benefits it provided such as assisting afforestation in arid lands, as a source of income for most families through the sale of pods, charcoal and furniture production. Despite these positive characteristics, mesquite invasion was found to cause ecological, economic and social negative impacts across large parts of the world. The species can grow anywhere and is not limited by saline, alkaline or infertile soils. Moreover, inter-specific hybridization also enhances invasiveness in many introduced regions and thus tends to form dense impenetrable thickets associated with unfavourable impacts on human and economic activities. In addition, it overruns grazing land; negatively affects biodiversity and it excessively consumes surface and ground water. Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand the spatial distribution of the Prosopis species with relation to the other co-existent species as well as the factors that drive invasions and shape management actions, and to compare the effectiveness of different management approaches. Hence, the aim of the study was to test the use of WorldView-2 image and a machine learning classifier in mapping the invasion of Prosopis in arid environment of South Africa. Specifically, the study used the Random Forest ensemble (RF) to map Prosopis glandulosa and other co-existent acacia species namely Acacia karoo and Acacia mellifera as well as some general land cover types in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. The results of the present study revealed the robustness the machine learning classifier with an overall accuracy of 86.59% and kappa value of 0.84 for RF. This study concludes that the use WorldView-2 and the RF algorithm provide relatively accurate information that is important to the environmental management industry for making informed decisions regarding the Prosopis invasion.

AB  - Quantification of forest cover is essential as a tool to stimulate forest management and conservation. Image compositing techniques that sample the most suited pixel from multi-temporal image acquisitions, provide an important tool for forest cover detection as they provide alternatives for missing data dueto cloud cover and data discontinuities. At present, however, it is not clear to which extent forest coverdetection based on compositing can be improved if the source imagery is firstly corrected for topographicdistortions on a pixel-basis. In this study, the results of a pixel compositing algorithm with and withoutpreprocessing topographic correction are compared for a study area covering 9 Landsat footprints inthe Romanian Carpathians based on two different classifiers: Maximum Likelihood (ML) and SupportVector Machine (SVM). Results show that classifier selection has a stronger impact on the classificationaccuracy than topographic correction. Finally, application of the optimal method (SVM classifier withtopographic correction) on the Romanian Carpathian Ecoregion between 1985, 1995 and 2010 shows asteady greening due to more afforestation than deforestation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Plantations are important REDD+strategies for increasing carbon sequestration while enhancing local livelihoods. Reforestation along roads and highways under participatory forest management in southwestern Bangladesh could contribute to REDD+. This study assessed the diversity and structure of roadside plantations in order to develop a basal area based generalized allometric model for estimating above- and below-ground tree biomass carbon in Southwestern Bangladesh. All woody plants with d.b.h. ≥2cm were identified and their diameters measured in 108 systematically selected zigzag plots of equal size (2×10m). A total of 36 species in 17 families were recorded. Leguminosae accounted for 28% of species and 94% of the total estimated biomass carbon. We estimated a mean stem density of 4528ha-1, basal area of 52.6m2ha-1 and biomass carbon of 192.80Mgha-1. Samanea saman, Dalbergia sissoo, Acacia nilotica, and Leucaena leucocephala accounted for most density, basal area, and carbon. We developed and validated three allometric models with equal strength (R2 0.94-0.98) using generalized linear regression. Roadside plantations in Bangladesh can now surely participate in the UNFCCC's carbon mitigation and adaptation mechanism, but challenges to their long-term sustainability must be addressed. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Wind disturbance is the main natural driver of forest dynamics in Central and Northern Europe, but little is known regarding the general patterns of tree regeneration following windthrow in this region. On the basis of 89 windthrow gaps, we quantified natural tree regeneration 10 and 20years after wind disturbance, and identified the factors influencing tree regeneration dynamics, with a special emphasis on the post-storm management practices "salvage logging" and "no intervention". The sample encompasses gaps of ≥3ha and total overstory mortality caused by wind disturbance. The gaps date back to the two catastrophic storm events Vivian in 1990 and Lothar in 1999. Gaps covered an ecologically diverse region extending over 20,000km2 and ranging from 370 to 1780ma.s.l. on the Central Plateau and in the Alps of Switzerland (Central Europe). Regeneration status was assessed on six circular sample plots per windthrow gap in 2010/2011. We recorded soil pH, organic layer, post-windthrow treatment, elevation, aspect, slope, browsing damage, and presence of predominant vegetation cover. We compared regeneration density and composition in gaps with and without salvage logging and elucidated the most important environmental factors influencing tree regeneration after wind disturbance using generalized linear models (GLMs). Ten and twenty years after wind disturbance, late-successional tree species such as beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) frequently dominated, independent of the post-storm treatment. Salvage logging did not negatively affect pre-storm regeneration and even positively influenced post-storm tree regeneration. GLMs revealed soil pH (+) and ground vegetation cover (-) to be the most important predictors of sapling density. The findings demonstrate that site factors have a stronger effect than post-storm treatment. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Differential growth response to light level is widely accepted as a potential mechanism for maintaining tree species richness in tropical forests. The position of tree species in the hierarchy of the canopy is considered an important indicator of species light capture and growth strategy. Paradoxically, the relative importance of species identity and competition for light in determining individual tree growth is poorly documented at the adult stage. In this study, we used a hierarchical Bayesian model to quantify the overall importance of species identity, light and belowground competition as determinants of tree growth in French Guiana tropical forest. Light competitive status is assessed by a crown exposure score and below ground competition is estimated from local crowding. We examined species sensitivity to both types of competition in relation to adult stature. Our results are based on annual diameter increments of more than 13,510 stems from 282 species monitored over 10years. Mean annual growth rate was 0.11cmy-1 with species identity explaining 35% of the individual variation in growth rate. Crown exposure and local crowding explained 3.5% and 2.4% of the variation in growth rate, respectively. Predicted changes in growth rate as crown exposure (resp. local crowding) index changed from lower to upper interquartile level was 0.03cmy-1 (resp. 0.02cmy-1). Species sensitivity to crown exposure and to local crowding were positively correlated (i) with predicted growth rate at high-light standardized conditions and (ii) with adult stature.This vertical niche partitioning is invoked to explain the limited contribution made by level of light competition for predicting individual tropical tree growth as the community-level response is dominated by the abundance of small-statured species with low sensitivity to light level.Light appears to drive the stem growth rate of tropical trees through species differentiation more than through individual tree growth limitation. This vertical stratification complements the previously reported regeneration niche and together these provide evidence for light niche partitioning in the three-dimensional space of tropical forests. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The active effect of natural regeneration on understory vegetation and diversity on clear-cut forestlands, in contrast to conifer reforestation, is still controversial. Here we investigated differences in understory vegetation by comparing naturally regenerated deciduous forests (NR) and reforested spruce plantations (SP) aged 20-40 years on 12 similar clear-cuts of subalpine old-growth spruce-fir forests from the eastern Tibetan Plateau. We found that 283 of the 334 vascular plant species recorded were present in NR plots, while only 264 species occurred in SP plots. This was consistent with richer species, higher cover, and stem (or shoot) density of tree seedlings, shrubs, and ferns in the NR plots than in the SP plots. Moreover, understory plant diversity was limited under dense canopy cover, which occurred more frequently in the SP plots. Our findings implied that natural deciduous tree regeneration could better preserve understory vegetation and biodiversity than spruce reforestation after clear-cutting. This result further informed practices to reduce tree canopy cover for spruce plantations or to integrate natural regeneration and reforestation for clear-cuts in order to promote understory vegetation and species diversity conservation. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - Strict enforcement of forest protection and massive afforestation campaigns have contributed to a significant increase in China's forest cover during the last 20 years. At the same time, demographic changes in rural areas due to changes in reproduction patterns and the emigration of younger population segments have affected land-use strategies. We identified proximate causes and underlying drivers that influence the decisions of farm households to plant trees on former cropland with Bayesian networks (BNs). BNs allow the incorporation of causal relationships in data analysis and can combine qualitative stakeholder knowledge with quantitative data. We defined the structure of the network with expert knowledge and in-depth discussions with land users. The network was calibrated and validated with data from a survey of 509 rural households in two upland areas of Yunnan Province in Southwest China. The results substantiate the influence of land endowments, labor availability and forest policies for switching from cropland to tree planting. State forest policies have constituted the main underlying driver to the forest transition in the past, but private afforestation activities increasingly dominate the expansion of tree cover. Farmers plant trees on private incentives mainly to cash in on the improved economic opportunities provided by tree crops, but tree planting also constitutes an important strategy to adjust to growing labor scarcities. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The future resilience of Pinus radiata D. Don (Monterey pine) is dependent upon the development of a silviculture program inclusive of either preventative or management techniques for the potentially fatal pitch canker disease (Fusarium circinatum Nirenberg and O'Donnell (=F.subglutinans (Wollenw and Reinking) Nelson et al. f. sp. Pini). As an ecologically and commercially valued species of limited natural range, a number of factors threaten to reduce the Monterey pine gene pool potentially impacting its long-term resilience. This study evaluated the effectiveness of uneven-aged forest management for regeneration success applied in the native, pitch canker infested Año Nuevo stands at Swanton Pacific Ranch in Davenport, California. The impact of gap size (0.20-ha (0.50 acre), 0.10-ha (0.25 acre), and 0.05-ha (0.125 acre)), site-preparation treatment (pile and burn, lop and scatter), and parent tree (13 local seed sources) on seedling survival and growth response (height, diameter) were addressed. Pitch canker symptoms were quantified to conclude if there is indeed a range of expressed resistance according to parent tree. The above independent variables were also examined for being correlated with branch tip incidence of pitch canker and western gall rust disease.A generalized linear mixed model estimated that the odds of seedling survival varied by site treatment and parent, but not by gap size. Pile and burn sites were estimated to have higher survival rates than lop and scatter sites. Linear mixed models estimated that gap size was associated with average seedling growth, both in terms of height and diameter. Parent and site treatment were not found to be significantly associated with the growth outcome measures. The 0.05-ha sites had smaller average height and diameter than the 0.20-ha sites. The 0.10-ha site also had smaller average diameter than the 0.20-ha sites. The presence of pitch canker disease on branch tips was found to be correlated only with gap size, with 0.10-ha sites having higher pitch canker incidence than the 0.05- and 0.20-ha sites. Though gall rust presence on branch tips was not associated with any of the hypothesized independent variables, there was an association between gall rust presence and pitch canker presence on branch tips. Site treatment and parent tree were associated with seedling survival, while gap size was found to be associated with seedling growth and disease resistance. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper analyses the effect of selected site and stand variables on the natural regeneration of the late-successional species Abies alba Mill. in a sequence of stands with increasing partition of three other tree species: light-demanding early-successional Pinus sylvestris (L.), moderately shade-tolerant Picea abies (L. Karst.), and shade-tolerant late-successional Fagus silvatica (L.). The data used originated from inventories carried out in publicly owned forests in southern Poland on a total of 2262 stands in a 30,700. ha area. First, the effect of geographic location, altitude, slope, aspect, site trophism, stand age, stand volume and proportion of admixed species on the occurrence of A. alba regeneration was analysed using generalised linear models (GLZ). The empirical associations derived from these models were then compared with the expected outcomes for two scenarios of seedling over-dispersion given a decreasing number of trees producing seeds and a neutral effect of admixed species. The highest regeneration coverage was found in pure A. alba stands. In the mixed stands, regeneration coverage decreased with a decreasing proportion of A. alba, although at a lower rate than might be expected given a neutral effect of admixed species. The survival rate modelled in close to mono-specific stands (i.e., those with 90%) of P. abies, F. sylvatica and P. sylvestris was 3.0-8.5 times higher than in pure A. alba stands. Nevertheless, the reduced seed availability resulting from a lower number of seed producers in mixed stands might not be fully balanced by more advantageous microsite conditions. In stands with a high percentage of the early-successional species P. sylvestris, regenerative conditions were no more advantageous than in stands with a high percentage of late-successional species. The higher modelled survival rate of A. alba regeneration in stands of late-successional P. abies and F. sylvatica than in stands of con-specific trees may be viewed as an increase-when-rare mechanism. The question remains, however, of whether it is an intrinsically anthropogenic mechanism (e.g., increased herbivory pressure) or a natural mechanism capable of maintaining the mixed species composition of climax communities undisturbed by man. © 2013.

AB  - Development of appropriate forest conservation and management measures for a given tree species includes the identification of distinct genetically homogeneous units across its overall distribution range, which depends on the availability of knowledge on genetic, morphological and adaptive variation. This has important implications for germplasm transfer within and between areas, for example in reforestation or restoration activities. Genetic zones are defined as genetically more or less homogeneous regions within which propagation material can be transferred with relative certainty not to cause changes at the genetic structure level. The main goal of this study was to define genetic zones for Nothofagus nervosa and Nothofagus obliqua within their Argentinean natural distribution range. A total of 823 individuals belonging to 24 populations (14 of N. nervosa and 10 of N. obliqua, μ=. 34. ±. 5) were genotyped by means of seven nuclear microsatellite markers. The geographic clustering encountered through the application of a Bayesian approach was analyzed in combination with additional information on diversity parameters, chloroplast DNA and isozymes. For assembling the maps showing the distribution of clusters, we averaged cluster membership values of trees in each grid cell. To visualize geographical patterns in nSRR richness and the distribution of different clusters of both species, we carried out grid-based spatial analyses using 30. s grid cells (~1. km at the equator) as the unit of analyses. We distinguished five genetic zones for N. nervosa and three for N. obliqua, consistent with the management history of the species, and displaying a certain level of geographic congruence. Higher allelic richness values were found in the surroundings of areas identified as potential glacial refugia, which suggest that the distribution pattern of allelic richness is closely associated with the glacial history of the species within the region. We expect this information to constitute a valuable tool for the identification of seed transfer zones, and to guide recruitment and plantation activities in the context of domestication programs of both species in Argentina. For assisted migration programs under progressive climate change the identification of these zones together with knowledge concerning hotspots at genetic diversity level should constitute an input for planning the activities. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The impacts on the landscape after forest harvesting in reforestation are visible, but the cutting is a necessary process to ensure a sustained yield and introduce new technologies. An alternative of control is to use the adjacency constraints in the mathematical models. Thus, the aim of the study was to assess the ability of the metaheuristic SA to solve mathematical models with adjacency constraints type URM, and to check its action with the increasing of the problem complexity. The study was conducted in a forest project containing 52 stands, and created 8 scenarios, where the Johnson and Scheurmann (1977) model I was used as reference. The adjacency constraint type URM was used to control the cutting of adjacent stands. The models were solved by the ILP and metaheuristic SA, which was sued 100 times per scenario. The results showed that the scenario 8 has consumed 137.530 seconds via PLI, which represented 2.023,09 times more than the average time processing of the SA metaheuristic (67,98 seconds). The best solutions were 4.71 % (scenario 1) to 11.40 % (scenario 8) far from the optimal (ILP). The metaheuristic SA is capable to solve the forest problem, meeting the targets in the most cases. The increasing of complexity produced a higher deviation from the optimal. Concludes that the metaheuristic SA should not be processed a single time, because there are hazards in obtain inferior solutions, but doing it is recommended to increase the stop criterion.

AB  - High deer populations threaten the conservation value of woodlands and grasslands, but predicting the success of deer culling, in terms of allowing vegetation to recover, is difficult. Numerical simulation modeling is one approach to gain insight into the outcomes of management scenarios. We develop a spatially explicit model to predict the responses of Betula spp. to red deer (Cervus elaphus) and land management in the Scottish Highlands. Our model integrates a Bayesian stochastic stage-based matrix model within the framework of a widely used individual-based forest simulation model, using data collected along spatial and temporal gradients in deer browsing. By initializing our model with the historical spatial locations of trees, we find that densities of juvenile trees (<3 m tall) predicted after 9-13 years closely match counts observed in the field. This is among the first tests of the accuracy of a dynamical simulation model for predicting the responses of tree regeneration to herbivores. We then test the relative importance of deer browsing, ground cover vegetation, and seed availability in facilitating landscape-level birch regeneration using simulations in which we varied these three variables. We find that deer primarily control transitions of birch to taller (>3 m) height tiers over 30 years, but regeneration also requires suitable ground cover for seedling establishment. Densities of adult seed sources did not influence regeneration, nor did an active management scenario where we altered the spatial configuration of adults by creating "woodland islets". Our results show that managers interested in maximizing tree regeneration cannot simply reduce deer densities but must also improve ground cover for seedling establishment, and the model we develop now enables managers to quantify explicitly how much both these factors need to be altered. More broadly, our findings emphasize the need for land managers to consider the impacts of large herbivores rather than their densities. © 2013 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution.

AB  - Questions: What are the effects of conifer invasion on plant species composition and richness of coastal heathlands; do effects differ between heathlands invaded by introduced or native coniferous tree species? Location: Threatened coastal Calluna heathlands, western Norway. Methods: We compared the effects of invasion by introduced Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) and native Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) on heathland plant communities by focusing on the local impacts of single coniferous tree canopies. For each of 58 target coniferous trees (2-4-m tall), 2-m transects were laid out in a north and south orientation from the tree stem to beyond the tree canopy, and control transects were laid out in open heathland adjacent to the target trees. Vascular plants and bryophytes were recorded within 0.0625 m2 contiguous quadrats along the transects. Principal response curves (PRC) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used to investigate tree canopy effects on species composition and richness. Results: Invasion by coniferous trees induced considerable changes in the coastal heathland vegetation: distinct microcommunitites developed beneath the canopies of relatively young, single coniferous trees in the heathlands. There was a marked difference in subcanopy species composition under the introduced Sitka spruce relative to the native Scots pine; forest floor species had colonized to a greater extent under Sitka spruce, replacing the light-demanding species characteristic of the coastal heathland vegetation. Conclusion: Our study showed that conifer invasion induces considerable and rapid changes in heathland vegetation, and that the effects were stronger under the introduced conifer. This suggests that Sitka spruce invasion may pose a more immediate threat to the characteristic coastal heathland vegetation and flora than succession based on native conifers. The open coastal heathlands along the Atlantic coast of Western Europe are a threatened landscape of high conservation value, and our results suggest that the spread of Sitka spruce into these landscapes should be controlled, especially in heathlands that are targeted for conservation. © 2012 International Association for Vegetation Science.

AB  - The Atlantic Rain Forest is one of the most important Brazilian biomes and a hotspot for biodiversity that is characterized by its high level of endemism, where new species are still being described. Luehea divaricata (Malvaceae) is commonly found in riparian forests areas of the Atlantic forest. Because of the importance of this species in reforestation programs, we used nine pairs of microsatellite loci to study the genetic variability of this species along its distribution area and verify if fragmentation is compromising the survival of these populations. A total of 50 alleles were obtained with an average observed and expected heterozygosity of 0.53 and 0.67, respectively. Seven of the nine populations studied showed a heterozygosity deficit. Most of the genetic diversity was found within populations; while the level of genetic differentiation was moderated (6.84) between populations. Different levels of gene flow between the populations were detected. Positive and significant values of Fis were found for seven populations. The signal test for excess of heterozygosity indicated that a recent genetic bottleneck occurred in the fragmented populations. The dendrogram constructed by the UPGMA method revealed the formation of seven clusters, which was confirmed by the Bayesian analysis for number of K clusters. The presence of several pairs of loci in linkage disequilibrium confirms that these populations experienced a loss of genetic diversity caused by genetic drift. The results showed that it is necessary to develop management strategies for the conservation of these populations of L. divaricata as the viability of the next generations are severely compromised. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - A sound knowledge of the soil properties required by tree species is a prerequisite for addressing many practical and scientific issues such as forest management or the predictive mapping of tree species. To date, such knowledge has been derived mainly from laboratory experiments and from case studies in the field. The importance of soils for the distribution of tree species has, however, hardly been tested systematically with comprehensive data including climate, soil and vegetation inventories.In our study, we analysed a comprehensive database to explore how soil and topo-climatic properties relate to the abundance of regenerating and mature beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) in mature forests across Switzerland.From 806 forest plots distributed all over strong environmental gradients, we used soil and topo-climatic data as predictors and the abundances of tree species in the herb and in the tree layer as response variables. To test the explanatory power of the predictors, we conducted variation partitioning analyses with generalized linear models. Soil predictors involved nutrients, potentially toxic elements, soil aeration and water availability. The explanatory power of most soil predictors was tested in different soil layers to a depth of 1. m.Ash and sycamore were much more sensitive to soil variables than beech. The most relevant soil variables for the competitive ability of the three species were C/N-ratio, humus form, aluminium content, base saturation, magnesium content, and soil aeration. Shortage of nutrients limited the distribution of ash and sycamore and excess of toxic elements the distribution of ash. For beech, no soil-induced distribution limits were detectable. Ash was absent if the C/N-ratio in the topsoil was greater than 20. On such sites, sycamore was absent too or reached heights of at most 15-20. m, i.e. well below the upper canopy. Ash was absent or reached a maximum height of 15. m on acidic soils including at least one soil layer with a base saturation less than 20% in the upper 1. m of the soil. The soil properties relevant for the competitive ability of ash and sycamore were more apparent for mature than for regenerating trees. In most cases, the topsoil influenced tree abundances more than the subsoil did. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Declining forest health, climate change, and development threaten the sustainability of water supplies in the western United States. While forest restoration may buffer threats to watershed services, funding shortfalls for landscape-scale restoration efforts limit management action. The hydrologic response and reduction in risk to watersheds following forest restoration treatments could create significant nonmarket benefits for downstream water users. Historic experimental watershed studies indicate a significant and positive response from forest thinning by a reallocation of water from evapotranspiration to surface-water yield. In this study, we estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) for improved watershed services for one group of downstream users, irrigators, following forest restoration activities. We find a positive and statistically significant WTP within our sample of $183.50 per household, at an aggregated benefit of more than $400,000 annually for 2181 irrigators. Our benefit estimate provides evidence that downstream irrigators may be willing to invest in landscape-scale forest restoration to maintain watershed services. © 2013. American Geophysical Union.

AB  - I developed a weeding-duration model for Sakhalin fir (Abies sachalinensis (Fr. Schmidt) Masters) plantations that employs a generalized linear model. The number of years following planting that weeding is necessary is the response variable, and elevation, slope steepness, maximum snow depth, annual precipitation, geology, soil, site index, slope aspect, and vegetation type are explanatory variables. Among the explanatory variables, geology, soil, slope aspect, and vegetation type are categorical data. A Poisson distribution is assumed for the response variable, with a log-link function. Elevation, slope steepness, maximum snow depth, annual precipitation, site index, and vegetation type had a significant effect on weeding duration. Among the eight models with the smallest Akaike information criterion (AIC), I chose the model with no multicollinearity among the explanatory variables. The weeding-duration model includes site index, maximum snow depth, slope steepness (angle) and vegetation type as explanatory variables; elevation and annual precipitation were not included in the selected model because of multicollinearity with maximum snow depth. This model is useful for cost-benefit analyses of afforestation or reforestation with Abies sachalinensis. © 2013 Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Traditional agro-pastoral practices are in decline over much of the Alps, resulting in the complete elimination of livestock grazing in some areas. Natural reforestation following pastoral abandonment may represent a significant threat to alpine biodiversity, especially that associated with open habitats. This study presents the first assessment of the potential effects of natural reforestation on dung beetles by exploring the relationships between the beetle community (abundance, diversity, species turnover and assemblage structure) and the vegetation stages of ecological succession following pastoral abandonment. A hierarchical sampling design was used in the montane belt of the Sessera Valley (north-western Italian Alps). Dung beetles were sampled across 16 sampling sites set in four habitat types corresponding to four different successional stages (pasture, shrub, pioneer forest and beech forest) at two altitudinal levels. The two habitats at the extremes of the ecological succession, i. e. pasture and beech forest, had the greatest effect on the structure of local dung beetle assemblages. Overall, dung beetle abundance was greater in beech forest, whereas species richness, Shannon diversity and taxonomic diversity were significantly higher in pasture, hence suggesting this latter habitat can be considered as a key conservation habitat. Forests and pastures shared a lower number of species than the other pairs of habitats (i. e. species turnover between these two habitats was the highest). The two intermediate seral stages, i. e. shrub and pioneer forest, showed low dung beetle abundance and diversity values. Local dung beetle assemblages were also dependent on season and altitude; early-arriving species were typical of pastures of high elevation, whereas late-arriving species were typical of beech forests. It is likely that grazing in the Alps will continue to decrease in the future leading to replacement of open habitats by forest. This study suggests therefore that, at least in the montane belt, reforestation may have potentially profound and negative effects on dung beetle diversity. Maintaining traditional pastoral activities appears to be the most promising approach to preserve open habitats and adjacent beech forests, resulting in the conservation of species of both habitats. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The influence of forest management on stand structure and genetic diversity was studied in a European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest in the Gran Sasso - Laga National Park, Apennine Mountains, central Italy.Field work was carried out in two plots to compare both spatial structure and genetic variability between an old-growth beech stand and a post-harvest naturally regenerated stand.The study was based on a total census of living trees within the plots. Vertical and horizontal stand structures were analyzed by means of spatial functions. Individuals were genotyped with four highly polymorphic nuclear microsatellite loci (nSSRs) and with RAPD markers. Population spatial genetic structure was inferred using a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chains method implemented in the Geneland software.The major structural differences distinguishing the old-growth stand from the managed stand were tree size differentiation, vertical crown distribution and horizontal stem distribution.Concerning genetic features, the managed stand presented no significant differences from the unmanaged stand. Nevertheless, the old growth forest had a higher spatial structuring of genetic diversity than did the managed stand. Molecular markers (nSSR alleles and RAPD fragments) detected in the unmanaged stand were rarely detected in the managed stand, and rare markers were lost. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Afforestation of agricultural land to mitigate climate change and other environmental degradation has been increasingly implemented around the world. However, the effects of afforestation on soil carbon and particularly nitrogen content remain unclear. We conducted a hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis of published data on the effects of afforestation of pastures on soil carbon and nitrogen stocks in a Mediterranean climate. We found no evidence for substantial changes in soil carbon, nitrogen or C:N ratio across three decades of afforestation. However, a lack of data on the carbon content of the litter underestimates the potential for afforestation to sequester carbon in the soil. We investigated soil carbon content under remnant woodlands and found that it was higher than under the afforested pastures suggesting that afforestation has the potential to increase soil carbon over longer time scales. Targeted studies that measure carbon content and form within soils over an extended chronosequence are much needed to improve predictions of the potential for afforestation to increase soil carbon storage. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recruitment represents the net effect of seed dispersal and survival (germination and establishment) processes. Both are known to be a function of distance from the seed trees. Seed densities usually decline with distance from the seed trees and the survival function can have different shapes. It may e.g. increase with distance (Janzen-Connell type effects) or decrease in the case of facilitation. In recruitment modeling the dispersal kernel is often directly fitted to the number of saplings instead of to the number of seeds, by indirectly assuming a distance-invariant survival function. This assumption may be violated in many cases as the survival function may attain different shapes. The interaction of distance-dependent seed deposition and survival becomes more complex in the case of several seed trees, since processes shaping the survival function may act on seeds from different seed trees. We develop a recruitment model disentangling (1) seed dispersal as derived by a summed seed shadow model and (2) survival as a function of distance of several nearby seed trees. Using Bayesian model inversion we parameterize our model for post fire Pinus sylvestris regeneration, which is known to suffer from strong root competition in the vicinity of seed trees. We show that accounting for distance-dependent survival substantially improves the model performance for three tested seed dispersal kernels. We show that ignoring distance-dependency of survival leads to ecologically unrealistic parameter estimates, questionable seed dispersal properties and biased sapling density predictions at the landscape level. Disentangling seed dispersal and survival processes is essential for modeling recruitment patterns in the case of distance-dependent survival. Our model helps to learn about the connection between seed and sapling patterns particularly when several seed trees are present. Our modeling approach derives separate seed dispersal kernels, survival functions, and the resulting recruitment-patterns, also when only sapling counts are available. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Previous studies have debated the flammability of young regenerating stands, especially those in a matrix of mature forest, and no consensus has emerged as to whether young stands are inherently prone to high-severity wildfire. This topic has recently been addressed using spatial imagery, and weak inferences were made given the scale mismatch between the coarse resolution of spatial imagery and the fine resolution of mechanisms driving fire severity. We collected empirical stand and fire-severity data from 44 regenerating stands that are interspersed in mature, mid-elevation forests in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest (OWNF) on the eastside of the Cascade Range in Washington, USA. These stands are mixed-species plantations that were established to promote regeneration of seral to late-seral tree species (Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, western larch) in small patches within a larger lodgepole pine forest. In 2006, the 70,925. ha Tripod Fire burned through all the plantations and the surrounding lodgepole pine matrix. To understand what drives fire effects in plantations, especially those that exist in spatially heterogeneous forests, we compared fire severity in plantations with and without fuels-reducing site preparation (i.e., fuel treatments), using three metrics to quantify severity: mortality (%), exposed mineral soil (%), and char height (m). We built generalized linear models for each severity metric and tested for a difference in all severity metrics between treated and untreated units using Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance. Units without fuel treatments have more severe fire effects: mortality is 77% in untreated units and 37% in treated units (p= 0.0005). Other variables contribute to differences in fire severity, including species composition, canopy closure, and canopy base height. Canopy base height and canopy closure both exhibit a reverse relationship with mortality from what was expected: the higher the canopy closure and the lower the canopy base height, the lower the mortality. In other words, stands that have trees closer together with crowns near the ground are more likely to have lower mortality. Overall, the results suggest that young stands in some dry mixed conifer forests can be resilient to wildfire if surface fuel loading is low upon stand establishment. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We assessed multiple environmental factors that might influence the population vitality of the epiphytic lichen Lobaria pulmonaria at the individual tree and habitat levels in partially overgrown wooded meadows in Estonia. A total of 301 trees of four species were sampled at nine study plots, using a stratified factorial scheme, 151 colonized by L. pulmonaria and 150 not colonized by L. pulmonaria forming the control group. We used the Generalized Linear Models (GLZ) to identify a complex of factors which predicts the probability of the lichen occurring on tree trunks and the presence of apothecia on its individuals. We employed the General Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to study the relationship between cover of L. pulmonaria and environmental factors. The occurrence probability of L. pulmonaria on tree trunks increased with increasing light availability and height of deciduous shrubs near the trunk, and decreased with increasing distance to the nearest colonized tree. The host tree species and its trunk properties were also of importance, particularly the facilitating effect of the cover of bryophytes upon L. pulmonaria. The probability of occurrence of apothecia increased with maximum values of bark pH and cover of L. pulmonaria on the trunk. We conclude that partially overgrown wooded meadows are suitable habitats for L. pulmonaria. However, to maintain the vitality of these populations, a specific management scheme, preventing development of a dense stand, should be applied. Management requirements would include 1) selective cutting of overgrowing coniferous trees (particularly spruce), 2) preservation of adult and younger potential host trees within 10-20 m of colonized trees, 3) preservation of scattered deciduous shrubs in the vicinity of the host trees. © 2012 British Lichen Society.

AB  - Recent studies showed that disturbances and water availability determine the richness among plants with different post-fire strategies of Mediterranean-type ecosystems. The aim of this study was to determine whether or not the scale of analysis has an influence on the effects of these factors and, therefore, on the segregation of the dominant post-fire strategies, obligate seeders and obligate resprouters, and facultative species. We recorded all woody species and geographical features on 94 (75 m 2) plots of cork oak woodlands in the southern Iberian Peninsula. For each regenerative type (resprouters, seeders and species with both traits-facultative species), we tested the relationship between the number of species and the predictors using a generalised linear mixed model. The fixed predictor considered at the large scale was altitude, and fixed predictors considered at the local scale were aspect (north/south) and disturbance (fire and clearing by heavy machinery; yes/no). The random predictor was the factor of site. When this factor did not have significant effect for some regenerative types, these relationships was tested using a generalised linear model. Resprouting species were most represented at lower altitudes and in undisturbed sites, while seeders were also at lower altitudes but mostly on south-facing slopes, especially south-facing disturbed sites. For facultative species, site is the most important variable. The proportion of seeders from the total species is not related to altitude, but it is related to disturbance and aspect. These results suggest that there is no segregation of the richness of seeders and resprouters at the large scale (altitudinal gradient). Differences appeared at the local scale (aspect and disturbance). © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Spring and early summer have been regarded as the biologically best direct seeding dates for Scots pine. The study focused on finding out if late autumn is also a reasonable period for direct seeding of pine in Finnish Lapland and what factors affect the success of seeding. In all, the inventory-based data consisted of 50 regeneration stands and 908 sample plots sown in the autumn; the data were hierarchically structured at the levels of stand and circular plot. The method used was to construct models for the seedling establishment and seedling height. Modeling was used to analyze the principal ecological factors influencing regeneration success. The density and height models were developed using the Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). The most significant variables affecting seedling establishment were temperature sum, proportion of prepared area, thickness of humus layer, stoniness, and distance from forest edge. Contrary to the hypothesis, late autumn can be regarded as a reasonable alternative period for direct seeding, at least in northern Fennoscandia. For confirmation of the results, more experimental research is needed. One must remember that the success of regeneration results from the combination of direct seeding and natural regeneration. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - In this study, a weeding-duration model for Larix kaempferi plantations was developed that employs a generalized linear model. The number of years that weeding is necessary is the response variable, and elevation, slope, maximum snow depth, annual precipitation, geological type, soil type, site index, slope aspect, and vegetation type are explanatory variables. Among the explanatory variables, geological type, soil type, slope aspect, and vegetation type are categorical data. We assumed a Poisson distribution for the response variable. The link function was log. Among the models that could be developed from these variables, we chose the model with the smallest Akaike's information criterion (AIC). The weeding-duration model can be written as follows: years that weeding is necessary = Exp (-0.0172833 × site index + 0.0014053 × maximum snow depth (cm) + 1.7417731). The results of this study imply that weeding of Larix kaempferi plantations is needed for more years as the maximum snow depth increases and fewer years as the site index increases. This model is useful for cost-benefit analyses of afforestation or reforestation with Larix kaempferi. © 2010 The Japanese Forest Society and Springer.

AB  - Natural regeneration in canopy gaps is a key process affecting long-term dynamics of many forests, including northern hardwood forests. The density and composition of regenerating trees are often highly variable, reflecting sensitivity to a suite of driving factors operating at different scales (e.g., harvest gap to regional landscape), including production of seeds, physical characteristics of gaps and stands, competition with non-tree vegetation, and browsing by animals. Multivariate analyses over broad geographic areas provide insights into the relative effects of these factors and permit exploration of spatial patterns in regeneration. We examined the effects of gap-, stand-, and landscape-scale factors on densities of tree seedlings (&lt;1m tall) and saplings (1-2m tall) in 59 selection-harvested northern hardwood stands located across a 4500km2 region of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. We used Bayesian multilevel modeling to account for the hierarchical structure of the data and assess uncertainty in parameter estimates. Sugar maple (Acer saccharum) saplings were absent from 61% of 154m2 plots centered in harvest gaps (n=347) despite its high shade tolerance and overstory dominance, but densities were high in other gaps. Densities of sugar maple seedlings and/or saplings were negatively associated with a combination of greater stand-scale densities of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), greater gap-scale cover of non-tree vegetation, and lower gap-scale light availability, with deer density having the greatest effect. Densities of unpalatable and commercially less valuable ironwood (Ostrya virginiana), the second most common regeneration species, were positively related to gap-scale seed-production potential but were unrelated to factors affecting sugar maple. Ironwood tended to replace sugar maple saplings in areas with high deer density. At the landscape scale, densities of sugar maple seedlings and saplings decreased with decreasing latitude and snow depth and increasing winter deer densities. These inverse spatial patterns suggest that deer herbivory can lead to landscape-scale variation in regeneration success. However, the spatial distribution of habitat types (a proxy for soil moisture and nutrient conditions) confound this observation, with higher densities of sugar maple generally located on stands with less nutrient-rich habitat types. Results demonstrate that combinations of factors operating at different scales, and with different relative magnitudes of impact, contribute to high variation in regeneration composition and density following timber harvest. Selection silvicultural practices, as currently applied, do not ensure regeneration of desirable species; practices might require modifications in general (e.g., increasing gap size) and to match them to regionally varying factors like deer density. © 2011.

AB  - Field abandonment has increased over several decades under a long-term recession in Japanese agriculture. To support effective farmland management or reforestation, the patterns of tree recruitment in abandoned fields, which influence management costs, need to be clarified. We investigated tree seedling establishment and microsite variables along forest-field transects in 11 abandoned fields adjacent to secondary broad-leaved forests in the eastern Kanto region of Japan. Generalized linear mixed model analysis indicated that tree seedling establishment in abandoned fields was not correlated with the period of abandonment. Instead, it was positively correlated with vegetation openness. The dominance of a woody vine (Pueraria lobata), an annual liana (Humulus japonicus), and a dwarf bamboo (Pleioblastus chino) mainly explained low vegetation openness within the fields. In addition, the establishment of evergreen tree seedlings and tree seedlings dispersed by hoarding was negatively correlated with the distance from the forest edge. In the forest interior, taller understory vegetation at the edge correlated with lower seedling establishment. These results suggest that seedling establishment across forest-field ecotones is restricted by the dominance of competitive natives within abandoned fields and distance-dependent limitations in both abandoned fields and adjacent forest. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Starting from the fact that stand structure is significantly disturbed and from the assumption that all stands of pedunculate oak at forest level older than 100 years are potentially considered for stand regeneration, it is obvious that forest planning and management have to define their priorities on the basis of which individual, potentially mature and mature stands, will be regenerated. The general objective of this paper is to research the structure and mutual impacts of stand, site and economic factors on the elements of stand structure in a greater area of pedunculate oak forests consisting of old or potentially mature pedunculate oak stands with a disturbed structure. Based on obtained structural relations, the goal was to determine by modeling the easily obtainable elements of the variable (model), which will represent the objective criterion for stand ranking according to the regeneration priority and structural and economic requirements. The subject of the research are pedunculate oak forests in the Central Posavina region, where 37 stands, with stocking of less than 0.8, were randomly selected and divided into 3 age groups (101-120 years, 121-135 years, &gt;135 years) in 16 management units. On a total of 146 established plots of 25 m radius, estimates and measurements were carried out of variables at the level of individual model trees (6 trees of the main species upper storey layer nearest to the plot centre) and of stand and site variables (2 breast-height diameters, crown diameter, tree height, base height of the crown and height of the widest part of the crown, varietal trunk structure, crown defoliation, increment core, breast-height diameter of all trees higher than 1.3 m, seedlings, potential intermediate cutting, died trees, diameters of stump of cut trees, shrub layer, microrelief, canopy, health status, litter, understorey vegetation). The estimated and measured data were processed and appropriate variables for data analysis derived. The complex potential revenue (rent) difference was defined for stand regeneration (Equation 3) as a dependent variable and objective criterion for stand ranking according to regeneration priority. By means of partial linear analyses, multivariate analysis and modeling (generalized linear modeling), mutual and complex impacts of stand, site and economic factors on elements of stand structure and potential revenue (rent) difference were investigated. Statistical analyses were performed by application of the SAS software package, whereas descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, integration of functions and development of graphical presentations were carried out by means of the STATISTICA 8.2 software package. The research included different management, stand and structural characteristics (Table 1) and determined a statistically significant mutual impact of individual variables of stand, site and economic factors on certain elements of stand structure and potential revenue (rent) difference (Table 2). Multivariate analysis revealed models of complex impacts of stand, site and economic factors on standing volume of pedunculate oak and revenue (rent) difference (Table 3). According to the obtained data, all three models are statistically significant for the estimated standing volume of pedunculate oak and also for the estimated revenue (rent) difference. The stand factors in total account for 35% variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 22% variability of revenue (rent) difference. The site factors account for 39% variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 34% variability of revenue (rent) difference, whereas economic factors account for even 45% variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 43% variability of revenue (rent) difference. The results of the Tukey post hoc (HSD) test for statistically significant variables of multivariate analysis of the revenue (rent) difference and the standing volume of pedunculate oak (Table 4) indicate that there exists a relation between the standing volume of pedunculate oak as a complex structure element and the potential revenue (rent) difference. The results proved the existence of a direct impact of individual elements of main tree species as well as a complex impact of structure elements on the variable of potential revenue (rent) difference (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). The standing volume of pedunculate oak as a complex structure element is a suitable dependent variable, along with the revenue (rent) difference, for comparative analysis of impacts of statistically significant stand, site and economic factors on stand regeneration priority. Due to a significantly smaller standing volume of pedunculate oak as a consequence of its disturbed structure, there is a higher regeneration priority for the youngest stand group (100 to 119 years) in comparison with the older stands. Accordingly, in forests with disturbed structure age cannot be an objective criterion for planning stand regeneration. Stands with disturbed canopy of understorey layer with the smallest and lowest value of standing volume expectedly have the highest regeneration priority, i.e. their maintenance would lead to both economic losses and disturbed site conditions. In view of site preservation, the problem is particularly marked in case of pure stands, where pedunculate oak trees do not cover the soil in a sufficient measure, and have a worsening tendency due to weakening and dying of trees. According to the obtained results, which indicate that there is a relation between site and standing volume of pedunculate oak and revenue (rent) difference, stands with better site have lower regeneration priority. This is related to the fact that stand structure on a higher quality site is characterized by a lower number of pedunculate oak trees of larger dimensions and potentially large value increase, which is also characteristic of forest communities of pedunculate oak and common hornbeam. On average, a smaller standing volume of pedunculate oak in a floodplain pedunculate oak forest and a higher regeneration priority indicate disturbed structure conditions. Due to hydro-ameliorative works, this community has suffered even greater site changes and is more in danger of dieback, so regeneration will be more difficult and expectably less successful in case of stands with disturbed site and structure conditions, both at early and delayed regeneration. Regarding the proportional relation between the quantity of prescribed cut and the standing volume of pedunculate oak, stands with better structure and higher prescribed intermediate cut are expected to have a lower regeneration priority. A prescribed cut below 15 m 3/ha (50% sampled plots) indicates a significant share of preserved stands left to natural development, with necessary felling of only weak and dying trees by the beginning of regeneration or recovery. The stand structure characteristics according to their belonging to individual management units are more a consequence of spatial differences in site and structure conditions than a management characteristic. Thus we can separate 3 management units in the centre of the Lonjsko polje floodplain (@utica, Kutina floodplain forests and Brezovica), where dieback of pedunculate oak was the highest and which have a more marked stand regeneration priority in comparison to the management units with a more preserved structure of old stands (Trstika, Josip Kozarac). The impact of individual structure elements of pedunculate oak, unlike the rent, has a high correlation, with the exception of numbers of pedunculate oak trees. This can be explained by the fact that the same number of pedunculate oak trees can represent very different structural relations in terms of average dimensions of pedunculate oak trees, basal area and standing volume of pedunculate oak as well as different rate of other tree species in the structure. A particular significance with regards to the application of the results can be seen in the fact that easily obtainable structural elements, such as pedunculate oak basal area, number of pedunculate oak trees and diameter increment of pedunculate oak, proved to be very good indicators, which can explain nearly 70% variability of the complex impact on the revenue (rent) difference. The obtained research results prove the existence of a direct relation between stand structure and regeneration priority. There is, therefore, a practical possibility to apply the established complex variable of revenue (rent) difference for ranking of stands or stand parts (stand dividing) according to regeneration priority, which can be determined by means of easily obtainable elements of structure (tree numbers, basal area and diameter increment of pedunculate oak). An extension of the research into site-structure relations to include a greater, or even the entire area of pedunculate oak forests in Croatia as well as spatial and multiobjective forest management criteria (spatial distribution and area of stands for regeneration, habitat requirements) for stand regeneration planning would be a welcome continuation of this work.

AB  - We used a 5-decade chronosequence of harvest openings to characterize population and community-level responses of small mammals to forest management targeting oak regeneration in southern Indiana. Live-trapping at 42 different sites allowed modeling of occupancy and relative abundance using environmental covariates while incorporating imperfect detection. Species richness was higher in smaller openings on southwest-facing aspects. Similarity between species richness of different age classes decreased with increasing site age. Eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) relative abundance was greater in early seral stages, i.e., at young sites with low basal areas. Relative abundance of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) exhibited different responses to coarse woody debris on sites versus microsites. Pine voles (Microtus pinetorum) and short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda) were more likely to occupy older sites. We observed a greater relative abundance of short-tailed shrews at sites with steep and northeast-facing slopes. Northeast-facing slopes also resulted in higher short-tailed shrew occupancy rates. Incorporating detection probability enabled us to derive more accurate estimates of relative abundance and, when coupled with a Bayesian framework, permitted the estimation of occupancy for uncommon species. Our estimated responses can be used by forest managers to determine the potential impacts of even-aged and uneven-aged oak management on small mammals, and the statistical methodology we used can be applied even more broadly to improve understanding of wildlife responses to forest management. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The inability to obtain sufficient numbers of naturally regenerated trees following partial harvests of some Mediterranean Basin managed forests has prompted the need to critically assess common silvicultural practices. In this study, we examined Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) regeneration patterns under two shelterwood systems using a multiscale framework. The uniform shelterwood (US) system includes heavier and less frequent timber extractions than the group shelterwood (GS) system. Removal of competing vegetation to expose mineral soil (soil preparation) is sometimes used for US but is not commonly needed in GS. A generalized linear model was used to predict regeneration density for each shelterwood system using environmental variables at microsite and forest-level scales, medium-scale overstory tree characteristics, and spatial metrics that represent a range of spatial scales. Although US had a higher mean regeneration density, GS had a wider range of regeneration ages. The results derived from this study suggest that ground-level disturbance to break up the herb or organic layer may be required for regeneration establishment. This may occur during repeated partial harvests; otherwise, soil preparation may be required. Overall, this multiscale framework approach resulted in improved predictions and a better understanding of regeneration processes.

AB  - The sediments of Lake Fimon, N-Italy, contain the first continuous archive of the Late Pleistocene environmental and climate history of the southern Alpine foreland. We present here the detailed palynological record of the interval between Termination II and the Last Glacial Maximum. The age-depth model is obtained by radiocarbon dating in the uppermost part of the record. Downward, we correlated major forest expansion and contraction events to isotopic events in the Greenland Ice core records, via a stepping-stone approach involving intermediate correlation to isotopic events dated by TIMS U/Th in Alpine and Apennine stalagmites, and to pollen records from marine cores of the Iberian margin. Modelled ages obtained by Bayesian analysis of deposition are thoroughly consistent with actual ages, with maximum offset of ±1700 years. Sharp expansion of broad-leaved temperate forest and of sudden water table rise mark the onset of the Last Interglacial after a treeless steppe phase at the end of penultimate glaciation. This event is actually a two-step process which matches the two-step rise observed in the isotopic record of the nearby Antro del Corchia stalagmite, respectively dated to 132.5 ± 2.5 and 129 ± 1.5. ka. At the interglacial decline mixed oak forests were replaced by oceanic mixed forests, the latter persisting further for 7. ka till the end of the Eemian succession. Warm-temperate woody species are still abundant at the Eemian end, corroborating a steep gradient between central Europe and the Alpine divide at the inception of the last glacial. After a stadial phase marked by moderate forest decline, a new expansion of warm broad-leaved forests, interrupted by minor events and followed by mixed oceanic forests, can be identified with the north-alpine Saint Germain I. The spread of beech during the oceanic phase is a valuable circumalpine marker. The subsequent stadial-interstadial succession, lacking the telocratic oceanic phase, is also consistent with the evidence at the north-alpine foreland. The Middle Würmian (full glacial) is marked by persistence of mixed forests dominated by conifers but with significant lime and other broad-leaved species. A major Arboreal Pollen decrease is observed at modelled age of 38.7 ± 0.5. ka (larch expansion and last occurrence of lime), which has been related to Heinrich Event 4. The evidence of afforestation persisting south of the Alps throughout most of MIS 3 contrasts with a boreal and continental landscape known for the northern alpine foreland, pointing to a sharp rainfall boundary at the Alpine divide and to southern air circulation. This is in agreement with the Alpine paleoglaciological record and is supported by the pressure and rainfall patterns designed by mesoscale paleoclimate simulations. Strenghtening the continental high pressure during the full glacial triggered cyclogenesis in the middle latitude eastern Europe and orographic rainfall in the eastern Alps and the Balkanic mountains, thus allowing forests development at current sea-level altitudes. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study examined the factors that influence the size of a soil seed bank in Robinia pseudoacacia stands. We proposed two hypotheses: the amount of buried seeds of R. pseudoacacia is proportional to stand biomass rather than stand age, and apicultural utilization influences the size of the soil seed bank. R. pseudoacacia generally produces seeds with various degrees of physical dormancy. In addition, this tree is short-lived, and fecundity declines after 30-40 years in relation to tree vigor. However, R. pseudoacacia is intensively used in apiculture as an important honey source, and supply of honeybees by beekeepers could influence seed crops. We investigated 25 plantations in Hokkaido (Central, Hidaka, and Oshima) and in Nagano, Japan, where many naturally regenerated R. pseudoacacia stands occur. We found great variation in the size of the soil seed bank among stands, ranging from 13,757 to 6.4seedsm-2 per plot. A generalized linear mixed model revealed that both basal area (BARp) and apicultural utilization best explained the size of the soil seed bank. Both the positive effect of BARp and small contribution of stand age to the model implied that the soil seed bank is transitory, and will not persist for very long time. The large contribution of apicultural utilization to the size of the soil seed bank implied pollinator limitation under natural conditions. R. pseudoacacia often has large flower crops, and native pollinators can not keep up with the demand for pollination. Thus, the supply of honeybees by beekeepers should improve the pollination success of R. pseudoacacia. From these results, we conclude that we must consider stand history with respect to apicultural utilization if the land is harvested or a stand declines. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - High quality information on forest resources is important to forest ecosystem management. Traditional ground measurements are labor and resource intensive and at the same time expensive and time consuming. For most of the Slovenian forests, there is extensive ground-based information on forest properties of selected sample locations. However there is no continuous information of objectively measured vegetation height and canopy cover at appropriate resolution. Currently, Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) technology provides detailed measurements of different forest properties because of its immediate generation of 3D data, its accuracy and acquisition flexibility. However, existing LiDAR sensors have limited spatial coverage and relatively high cost of acquisition. Satellite data, on the other hand, are low-cost and offer broader spatial coverage of generalized forest structure, but are not expected to provide accurate information about vegetation height. Integration of LiDAR and satellite data promises to improve the measurement, mapping, and monitoring of forest properties. The primary objective of this study is to model the vegetation height and canopy cover in Slovenia by integrating LiDAR data, Landsat satellite data, and the use of machine learning techniques. This kind of integration uses the accuracy and precision of LiDAR data and the wide coverage of satellite data in order to generate cost-effective realistic estimates of the vegetation height and canopy cover, and consequently generate continuous forest vegetation map products to be used in forest management and monitoring. Several machine learning techniques are applied to this task: they are evaluated and their performance is compared by using statistical significance tests. Ensemble methods perform significantly better than single- and multi-target regression trees and are further used for the generation of forest maps. Such maps are used for land-cover and land-use classification, as well as for monitoring and managing ongoing forest processes (like spontaneous afforestation, forest reduction and forest fires) that affect the stability of forest ecosystems. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dragon spruce (Mast) is a conifer endemic to western China and a popular species for reforestation programs of this region. We used inter simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) molecular markers to conduct a population genetic study of nine geographically close stands from three types of dragon spruce forests: (1) intact, (2) plantation, and (3) natural regenerated following clearcut. Our main objective was to investigate the genetic structure of these populations and our expectation was that gene flow was an important evolutionary force among them. We were unable to sample a large number of individuals in each cohort. However, when young and mature cohorts from a particular stand were interpreted as a single unit, then sample size increased significantly. The highest levels of genetic diversity were found in mature cohorts of the intact forests, the lowest in young cohorts of these stands. Contrary to our expectations, low levels of gene flow existed between mature and young cohorts of different forest types; and most gene flow occurred between cohorts belonging to the same stand. There were major differences in the genetic structure of the three types of stands. Our results have conservation implications as the majority of wild populations of dragon spruce are small and fragmented. Low gene flow among populations will lead to high levels of genetic drift and a decline of genetic diversity within populations. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Determining what factors explain the distribution of non-native invasive plants that can spread in forest-dominated landscapes could advance understanding of the invasion process and identify forest areas most susceptible to invasion. We conducted roadside surveys to determine the presence and abundance of 15 non-native plant species known to invade forests in western North Carolina, USA. Generalized linear models were used to examine how contemporary and historic land use, landscape context, and topography influenced presence and abundance of the species at local and regional scales. The most commonly encountered species were Microstegium vimineum, Rosa multiflora, Lonicera japonica, Celastrus orbiculatus, Ligustrum sinense, and Dioscorea oppositifolia. At the regional scale, distance to city center was the most important explanatory variable, with species more likely present and more abundant in watersheds closer to Asheville, NC. Many focal species were also more common in watersheds at lower elevation and with less forest cover. At the local scale, elevation was important for explaining the species' presence, but forest cover and land-use history were more important for explaining their abundance. In general, species were more common in plots with less forest cover and more area reforested since the 1940s. Our results underscore the importance of considering both the contemporary landscape and historic land use to understand plant invasion in forest-dominated landscapes. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The paper is based on the research of forestry experts' systems funded by "National Tenth-Five-Year 863 Plan". In the context of the collective forest rights system reforms, in order to enhance the technological support to the farmers in the fast-growing and high-yield poplar cultivation, and to satisfy the actual needs of related enterprises, the study focuses on the fast-growing and high-yield poplar plantation harvest model and related decision-making criteria. Taking Populus tomentosa Carr as an example, by adopting the age-diameter at breast height growth model, diameter and tree height model, and the dual volume model based on Hebei Province's data, the age-volume produce model is constructed; by adopting market price of the non-discount method which is relatively easy for farmers, PNW (Present Net Worth) and LEV (Land Expectation Value) calculation methods, the economic benefits evaluation model is established. By using the calculation results of these models as a decision-making benchmark, the growth model, evaluation model and a calculation example of Populus tomentosa Carr are obtained. Based on the above-mentioned studies, the components and functions, model base and model resolver algorithm of the system are designed, and the economic benefits forecast process is set. The result of the research is applied to the "National Eleventh-Five-Year Plan" funded program "The research and application of key technologies in fast-growing and high-yield plantation production and management process informatization ". And the application obtains a satisfied result. By using harvest evaluation system to conduct economic benefits analysis of poplar varieties, the farmers and the investors can predict future earnings and make decisions in reforestation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Characterization of the suitability or potentiality of a territory for forest tree species is an important source of information for forest planning and managing. In this study, we compared a relatively simple methodology to generate potential habitat distribution areas that has been traditionally used in Spain (the potential index model) with a statistical modelling approach (generalized linear model). We modelled the potential distribution of mountain pine (Pinus uncinata) in the Iberian peninsula as a working example. The potential index model generated a map of habitat suitability according to the values of an index of potentiality, whose distribution has usually divided into four categories based on quartiles (from optimum to low suitability). Considering all values of the index of potentiality as presences of mountain pine resulted in a low to moderate degree of agreement between the potential index model and the generalized linear model according to the kappa coefficient. Using the cut-off value of the index of potentiality that maximized the degree of agreement between both modelling approaches resulted in a sub-stantial similarity between the maps of the predicted distribution of mountain pine. This cut-off value did lie in the upper-third quartile of the potential index distribution (high suitability category), and roughly coincided with the upper 30th percentile. The use of statistical techniques, which have proved to be powerful and versatile for species distribution modelling, is recommended. However, the potential index model, together with the adjustments proposed here, could be a reasonably simple methodology to predict the potential distribution of forest tree species that forest managers should take into account when evaluating forestation and afforestation projects. © Springer-Verlag 2008.

AB  - This paper analyzed the principal problems of forest pest and disease prevention in cultivating rapid-growing and high-yield forest. As the farmers and technicians lack expert guidance in preventing forest pests and diseases and the deficiency of consultant experts on the ground floor, a new consulting service system platform with multi-functions integrating forest pests forecasting, diagnosis, prevention and control were constructed. It is based on B/S structure by using J2EE-based open source framework. With the platform the users can get the explicit instructions from Internet Explorer. The platform not only provides effective scientific advice and technical supports for large number of foresters and forest corporations, but also reduces reforestation risks and enlarges forest productivity. Moreover, the platform can also be used for training and educational purposes. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - In this study, we analysed spatial genetic structure (SGS) patterns and estimated dispersal distances in Milicia excelsa (Welw.) C.C. Berg (Moraceae), a threatened wind-pollinated dioecious African tree, with typically low density (∼10 adults/km2). Eight microsatellite markers were used to type 287 individuals in four Cameroonian populations characterized by different habitats and tree densities. Differentiation among populations was very low. Two populations in more open habitat did not display any correlation between genetic relatedness and spatial distance between individuals, whereas significant SGS was detected in two populations situated under continuous forest cover. SGS was weak with a maximum Sp-statistic of 0.006, a value in the lower quartile of SGS estimates for trees in the literature. Using a stepwise approach with Bayesian clustering methods, we demonstrated that SGS resulted from isolation by distance and not colonization by different gene pools. Indirect estimates of gene dispersal distances ranged from σg = 1 to 7.1 km, one order of magnitude higher than most estimates found in the literature for tropical tree species. This result can largely be explained by life-history traits of the species. Milicia excelsa exhibits a potentially wide-ranging wind-mediated pollen dispersal mechanism as well as very efficient seed dispersal mediated by large frugivorous bats. Estimations of gene flow suggested no major risk of inbreeding because of reduction in population density by exploitation. Different strategy of seed collection may be required for reforestation programmes among populations with different extent of SGS. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - We assessed the effectiveness of alternative forest management strategies for maintaining American martens (Martes americana) in a sub-boreal landscape subject to an extensive mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreak, associated salvage logging, and climate change in north-central British Columbia, Canada. We structured the analysis in a Bayesian network (BN) meta-model that incorporated the results of spatially explicit modelling of landscape conditions (natural and logging disturbance, habitat quality, number of potential territories, and connectedness of territories) with analytical population modelling. The BN meta-model was then used to examine habitat and population size responses (adult females only are presented) to management scenarios, in the context of uncertainty of model parameters, management objectives, and climate change. Status quo management is dominantly clear-cutting with 3-20% of each harvest unit retained as mature patches, with reforestation by planting in the remainder. Management options we examined were: (1) the status quo, (2) varying the total annual timber harvest on the landscape (100%, 80% or 50% of current long-term sustained yield estimates), (3) the protection of understory trees during logging, and (4) 30-70% retention of overstory (partial cutting in distinct patches <1 ha in size) in each harvest unit, for 33% or 50% of the annual timber harvest. We found that marten habitat and population size declined substantively with the beetle outbreak and associated salvage cutting. The choice of management strategy then had a long-term effect on the potential for marten recovery after the beetle outbreak. Partial cutting scenarios had the greatest average long-term marten population levels, followed in order by reduced harvest rates, understory protection, and the status quo. Management scenarios with the best chance of meeting conservation goals without over-protecting habitat (and thus unnecessarily constraining timber management) varied with the population objective chosen. The choice of management strategy will depend on the weighting of marten outcomes against the economic desirability of timber harvest strategies, willingness to gamble on climate change, and the time-frame of interest.

AB  - Information on tree crown characteristics has been used in forestry to assess tree and ecosystem health and productivity. Although there are well known differences in crown functional traits between light-demanding pioneer species and later successional species, data is limited usually to regeneration phases. Further, information on variation between species within the pioneer guild is needed in order to select pioneer species for facilitation of reforestation, more shade demanding species, and for monitoring and evaluation of such efforts. In this study we assessed three crown functional characteristics - crown surface area, crown volume, and live crown ratio - in eight pioneer species commonly found in the tropical rain forests of Sri Lanka: Alstonia macrophylla Wallich ex G. Don, Dillenia triquetra (Rottb.) Gilg, Macaranga indica Wight, Macaranga peltata (Roxb.) Muell, Melastoma malabathricum L., Schumacheria castaneifolia Vahl, Trema orientalis (L.) Blume, and Wendlandia bicuspidata Wight & Arn. We modeled the influence of species, tree size, and environmental factors on these crown functional traits in seedling, sapling, and larger tree size classes using generalized linear models. We found that the disturbance environment was only influential at the larger tree size class. For smaller size classes, the majority of the variation in crown characteristics was explained by tree size characteristics. In larger trees, among the three functional traits, live crown ratio showed the strongest relationship with the disturbance environment and crown surface area and crown volume had higher correlation with tree height and diameter. While crown characteristics were influenced by species irrespective of size class, in the larger trees species varied in their relationship between tree crown functional traits and the disturbance environment. In larger trees, four species - M. indica, D. triquetra, S. castaneifolia, and W. bicuspidata, which are more commonly found in small gaps - had stronger relationships between crown surface area, live crown ratio and canopy openness than T. orientalis and M. peltata, which are more commonly found in large canopy openings, and A. macrophylla and M. malabathricum, two generalist species. The small gap specialists may develop deeper crowns to overcome the short duration of direct light in small gaps and more efficiently utilize lateral light which is a larger fraction of total light in these environments compared to large canopy openings. The differences among species must be considered in selecting pioneers for reforestation efforts and designing silvicultural treatments. We recommend a step wise introduction of species starting with the more high light restricted and generalist pioneers followed by the small gap restricted species and finally the late successional species.

AB  - The Wet Tropics Bioregion (WETB) is situated along the tropical northeastern coast of Queensland, Australia. Of the two million hectare bioregion, 45% is listed as World Heritage Area. The bioregion is mainly comprised of rugged mountains, with an extensive plateau area along the western margin and low-lying coastal plains on the east. Vegetation within the WETB is mostly rainforest, but includes mangrove forests, wet sclerophyll forests and tall open forests. The WETB comprises nine subregions (Sattler and Williams, 1999), including the Innisfail Lowlands subregion which comprises 10% (202,000 hectares) of the WETB area (Fig. 1). The subregion extends in a narrow band between 145o50' and 146o10'E (2-38 km wide) and 16o45' and 18o00'S (about 145 km long) along the Wet Tropics coast from the Tully River in the south to Palm Cove, 25 km north of Cairns. The lowlands are mainly of low relief (0 - 300 m) and, consequently, exhibit little spatial variation in mean annual temperature (23.5ºC - 24.75ºC). Mean annual rainfall of 2000 - 4500 mm is highest at the foot of the Bellenden Ker Range and decreases rapidly to the northwest of the ranges and more gradually to the south. As the subregion has rich soils and high rainfall, it has been progressively developed for agriculture, mainly sugar production, since the 1880s. The majority of the clearing for sugar cane cultivation had been completed prior to 1940, with 43.4% of the subregion's natural vegetation remaining in 2005 (Accad et al., 2008a). Although climate change affects individual species within vegetation communities in different ways and may lead to changing species composition in those communities, structural characteristics of vegetation communities vary systematically in response to climate. Furthermore, different structural vegetation communities will provide varied moderation of the effect of climate change on the same species. In this paper we investigate the potential changes in distribution of the structural rainforest communities of the Innisfail Lowlands subregion of northeastern Australia in response to climate changes predicted for the region. Predictions of increasing temperatures have a relatively high certainty, while changes in rainfall are less certain due to the complexity of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and model-building procedures are applied using Generalised Linear Modelling (GLM) and Generalised Additive Modelling (GAM) methods. The effects of climate change on the distribution of suitable habitat for each rainforest structural type are modelled. Our results show that even small climatic changes are likely to have substantial and markedly different effects on the various vegetation communities of the Innisfail Lowlands subregion. These results can assist in biodiversity management and planning by identifying areas of each vegetation community that are least affected by climate change and thus are potential refugia. The modelling can also identify previously cleared areas which have the potential to support rainforest communities threatened elsewhere by changes in climate. Strategic regeneration and subsequent management should be considered for those areas. © MODSIM 2009.All rights reserved.

AB  - The application of a decision support system (DSS) for selecting the best silvicultural treatment option in Iranian northern forests is presented. The DSS developed by Harald Vacik and Manfred J. Lexer was used. The decision problem is factorized into decisions on the future species mixture (GSO) and on an appropriate regeneration method (RM). A priori defined sets of alternatives (five species mixtures, six regeneration methods) are evaluated with respect to a set of stand-specific partial management objectives (timber production, conservation of biodiversity, recreation, protection against rock fall and avalanches) by further decomposing the partial objectives into decision criteria. An additive multiple-attribute preference model is used to aggregate the preferences at different levels of the decision hierarchy. The combination of GSO and RM which simultaneously maximizes the expected utility and satisfies all constraints of the forest decision maker is selected as the overall best solution. Finally, a species mixture of Fagus orientalis., Acer insigne, Quercus castanefolia (GS05) was considered to yield the highest utility with respect to a multiple-purpose management, with the main objective to secure the sustainable yield of timber production. With respect to the goal types, the most preferred regeneration systems were selection forest and strip-and-group selection. © 2009 EUROSIS-ETI.

AB  - Using a generalized linear mixed model approach, we determined the most important risk factors affecting the probability of damage by sika deer in a forest plantation in Japan. Candidate risk factors included tree species, stand age, peripheral dwarf bamboo community, topographical factors, snow depth, and human disturbance factors. Based on this model, we developed a risk map of forest damage. The model indicated that the most important risk factor was stand age, followed by tree species and maximum snow depth. Our predictive model has practical use due to its high classification accuracy (83.9%). To decrease damage from sika deer, an afforestation plan that incorporates these factors should be implemented. Because it is based on common, forest GIS data that have recently been compiled by several local governments in Japan, our modeling method of deer damage can easily be adapted to other areas. © 2008 International Consortium of Landscape and Ecological Engineering and Springer.

AB  - The present situation: The Hungarian forest area is 1853,2 thousand hectare, so 20% is the forest coverage. The species distribution is very original, when 87% of forest area has broadly species (EU countries: about 43%). The afforestation program: 25 years 750 thousand hectare new forest. The total harvest about 7000 thousand m3 pro year, so the country need softwood import, and cellulose and paper import. Hungary has a great export of hardwood lumber (oak, lack locust, beech), and chipboard export. Between wood products the furniture products has the greatest ratio. The forest based industry has 100000 employees, so it's a important industry. In our country there is engineer training in the Faculty of Forestry and the Faculty of Wood Sciences in Sopron. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - The general problem addressed by this study is that of designing a decision support system for planned adaptation to climate change that uses the principles of modern portfolio theory to minimise risk and maximise return of adaptive actions in an environment of deep uncertainty over future climate scenarios. Here we show how modern portfolio theory can use the results of a climate change impact model to select an optimal set of seed sources to be used in regenerating forests of white spruce in an environment of multiple, equally plausible future climates. This study shows that components of solutions are not selected to perform equally well across all plausible futures; but rather, that components are selected to specialise in particular climate scenarios. The innovation of this research rests in demonstrating that the powerful and widely used principles of quantifying and planning for risk and return in the uncertain environment of asset markets can be applied successfully to serve the objectives of planned adaptation to climate change. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - With the wide acceptance of forest-protection policies in the developing world comes a requirement for clear demonstrations of how deforestation may erode human well-being and economies. For centuries, it has been believed that forests provide protection against flooding. However, such claims have given rise to a heated polemic, and broad-scale quantitative evidence of the possible role of forests in flood protection has not been forthcoming. Using data collected from 1990 to 2000 from 56 developing countries, we show using generalized linear and mixed-effects models contrasted with information-theoretic measures of parsimony that flood frequency is negatively correlated with the amount of remaining natural forest and positively correlated with natural forest area loss (after controlling for rainfall, slope and degraded landscape area). The most parsimonious models accounted for over 65% of the variation in flood frequency, of which nearly 14% was due to forest cover variables alone. During the decade investigated, nearly 100 000 people were killed and 320 million people were displaced by floods, with total reported economic damages exceeding US$1151 billion. Extracted measures of flood severity (flood duration, people killed and displaced, and total damage) showed some weaker, albeit detectable correlations to natural forest cover and loss. Based on an arbitrary decrease in natural forest area of 10%, the model-averaged prediction of flood frequency increased between 4% and 28% among the countries modeled. Using the same hypothetical decline in natural forest area resulted in a 4-8% increase in total flood duration. These correlations suggest that global-scale patterns in mean forest trends across countries are meaningful with respect to flood dynamics. Unabated loss of forests may increase or exacerbate the number of flood-related disasters, negatively impact millions of poor people, and inflict trillions of dollars in damage in disadvantaged economies over the coming decades. This first global-scale empirical demonstration that forests are correlated with flood risk and severity in developing countries reinforces the imperative for large-scale forest protection to protect human welfare, and suggests that reforestation may help to reduce the frequency and severity of flood-related catastrophes. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - NED-2 is a goal-driven system designed to help manage timber, wildlife, visual, and ecological goals for a forested ecosystem. The basic approach of the decision process modeled by NED-2 is to develop alternative management plans for the stands in a management unit, to simulate these plans over time, and then to analyze the results of the simulation to see how well the management goals are achieved by the alternative plans. The basic simulation tool used in the system is the USDA Forest Service Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS.) FVS provides a regeneration component, but a need was recognized for making available alternative regeneration models. The first effort in this direction was to integrate a competitive model developed by David Loftis and implemented as a program called REGEN. This model uses pre-disturbance inventories of existing regeneration sources and information about new seedling establishment, particularly light-seeded species from the seedbank or from trees in areas adjacent to a stand. The stochastic model uses a knowledge base that allows ranking the competitive abilities of different species, taking into account the origin of the regeneration source-new seedling, stump-spout, or different sizes of pre-existing seedlings. Different knowledge bases can be developed for different forest types and regions. This model must be interleaved with FVS when the user desires to use the REGEN model. Individual NED-2 software agents control the FVS and REGEN systems. This paper describes how these agents communicate using a blackboard architecture to synchronize the operations of these two models. The task is made more complicated because regeneration on one stand can affect the results on regeneration on an adjacent stand at a later time.

AB  - Sediment transport and erosion is a complex natural process that is strongly influenced by human activities such as deforestation, agriculture and urbanization. In particular, suspended sediments play a key role in controlling water quality and they can cause a major reduction in the capacity of a stream for handling floods. In Algeria, increasing erosion and suspended loads are responsible for serious problems in agricultural land and hydraulic reservoirs, since the suspended load and its sedimentation lead to flooding and dam silting. Water and soil conservation practices, such as contour ridges and areas of reforestation, were introduced in many regions of Algeria in order to decrease erosion and to collect runoff in hill-slope catchments. Relationships for water discharge and suspended sediment load can be divided into three types: empirical models that allow quantification of erosion on annual time scales, such as the Wischmeier and Smith soil loss equation, conceptual models, which include several reservoirs estimating sediment load on different time scales; and finally, physically-based models, which introduce physical laws such as the Saint-Venant equation. These models represent another category, and allow the estimation of sediment load in different areas of the watershed and supply spatial results. These models also take into account numerous variables that are difficult to obtain on a regional scale. The objective of this research was to develop runoff-suspended sediment models for the Beni Amrane reservoir. This reservoir is located in the Isser-watershed, situated in northern Algeria. This basin covers an are of 4,000 km2 and is characterized by a semi-arid climate and a very high soil erosion rate, exceeding 2,000 tons/km2/year. The Beni Amrane reservoir represents an important dam as it supplies the Keddara dam, which in turn supplies the town of Algiers with drinking water. In the present study, two approaches to suspended sediment simulation were applied on hourly time scales for suspended sediment concentrations, and on daily time scales for water discharge and solid discharge analysis. The first approach is an empirical regression model based on a rating curve and uses a relationship between the observed runoff and the sediment concentration values. The model uses only two parameters, with the second being based on fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic is already used in many scientific domains, and represents a new simulation technique based on artificial intelligence. Fuzzy variables were used to organize knowledge that is expressed 'linguistically' into a formal analysis (for example 'high suspended sediment', 'average suspended sediment' and 'low suspended sediment'). The simulation results confirm the performances and robustness of the fuzzy logic model for the two time scales. In fact, the Nash criterion, which is the principal validation criterion for the models, displayed high performances in calibration and validation periods. The neurofuzzy model (fuzzy logic with neural supervised learning) offers a simulation advantage. On an hourly time scale, while increasing the number of fuzzy rules, the model results in good precision with the observed suspended sediments. The fuzzy logic model results showed that the Nash criterion for two periods (calibration and validation) was greater than 88%, and the peaks of suspended sediments were generally correctly reproduced for the four episodes studied. This is in contrast to the empirical model, where the Nash efficiency was generally weak and decreased during the validation period. In this latter period, the Nash criterion was often negative, the global error was high and the maximum concentration peak was underestimated. On a daily time scale, knowing the complexity of the runoff-suspended sediment process, we have analyzed these two models for solid discharge simulation. The study was carried out on daily solid discharge data collected from the gauging station on the Isser River (1986 to 1989). While based on the same validation criteria, i.e. the Nash efficiency and the global error, the fuzzy logic model appeared more robust than the empirical model. The fuzzy logic model produced better estimates of the daily sediment yield than the empirical model during calibration and validation periods, and it represents a high prediction power. Thus, we have validated the fuzzy logic model as a tool for simulation of runoff of suspended sediments, and it can be explored to predict sediment loading and silting in Algerian reservoirs.

AB  - Bayesian decision support tools are becoming increasingly popular as a modelling framework that can analyse complex problems, resolve controversies, and support future decision-making in an adaptive management framework. This paper introduces a model designed to assist the management of the endangered Camphora swamp eucalypt (Eucalyptus camphora). This tree species is found in the Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve (YNCR), an isolated patch of forest in the Yarra Valley (Victoria, Australia). The eucalypt community provides both habitat and food for a variety of threatened and endangered flora and fauna. Over the last 20 years the E. camphora has become increasingly threatened by dieback. In order to maintain and rehabilitate existing trees and encourage regeneration, management strategies and action plans have concentrated on restoring the hydrological regime, which has been altered due to agricultural activities within the catchment. However, research suggests that nutrient enrichment from surrounding horticulture and livestock is having a greater impact on the health of the trees. The Bayesian decision support tool has been used to examine the differences between these two hypotheses. The tool will also promote future integrative and iterative monitoring and research in the YNCR. This project was undertaken as part of a larger piece of work developing risk-based assessment guidelines for natural resource management, a process known as Ecological Risk Assessment. The Woori Yallock Creek Catchment, of which YNCR is a part, was chosen for the case study due to the high ecological assets identified in the catchment, the diverse land use and activities in the region, and the large body of knowledge and data available. The case study aims to identify environmental assets at greatest risk from ecological degradation in the Woori Yallock Creek Catchment and subsequently identify options for managing these risks. Phase One of the risk assessment process is problem formulation. Input was sought from a wide range of interest groups via one-on-one interviews and a workshop. The priority environmental assets in the catchment were subsequently identified, along with the hazards that threatened these assets. The Sedge-rich E. camphora community within YNCR was identified as one of the priority threatened environmental assets within the Woori Yallock Creek Catchment. For the purposes of this case study the condition of E. camphora was identified as the management end point for which YNCR will be managed. Phase Two (risk analysis) utilised Bayesian networks (BN) to quantify the risks to E. camphora. BNs are probabilistic networks that support reasoning under uncertainty. BNs are used to establish causal relationships between key factors and final outcomes, and maintain clarity by making causal assumptions explicit (Stow and Borsuk 2003). They are particularly useful for uncertainty analysis as they have the ability to consider inadequate knowledge or understanding of system processes, inherent randomness, subjective judgment and vagueness in parameter estimation, disagreement, measurement error and sampling error (Morgan and Henrion 1990). Risks to the condition of E. camphora have been prioritised and key knowledge gaps identified, while accounting for predictive uncertainties. Using the networks, the outcomes of a range of management scenarios have also been tested. The parameters that are most influential in determining E. camphora condition according to the model are generally soil nutrients, soil cations, pests or disease and inundation patterns (duration and frequency). The findings show E. camphora responses are different for each region in the model, and findings are specific for each survey. Much of the data used to parameterize the model was patchy and qualitative. This has contributed to significant knowledge gaps. The results of this study should be viewed as a guide to further work.

AB  - The study focused on constructing models for the establishment and seedling height development of naturally regenerated seedling stands in the natural regeneration of Scots pine by the seed-tree method in Lapland, northern Finland. Modelling was used to describe the dynamics of the regeneration process and to analyse the principal ecological factors and management activities influencing regeneration success. Models for the density of seedling stands were developed with the generalized linear mixed model method. The most significant variables affecting seedling establishment were elevation, time since the establishment cutting, the interaction of forest site type and site preparation, and stoniness. The results indicated that the average stocking level tends to remain unsatisfactory on moist, fertile site types without site preparation. Seedling height development was modelled as a function of age using the linear mixed model. Age explained 97% of the variance of seedling height. Other independent variables in the model were effective temperature sum, site preparation and the presence or absence of seed trees. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

AB  - The clearing of forests to obtain land for pasture and agriculture and the replacement of autochthonous species by other faster-growing varieties of trees for timber have both led to the loss of vast areas of forest worldwide. At present, many developed countries are attempting to reverse these effects, establishing policies for the restoration of older woodland systems. Reforestation is a complex matter, planned and carried out by experts who need objective information regarding the type of forest that can be sustained in each area. This information is obtained by drawing up feasibility models constructed using statistical methods that make use of the information provided by morphological and environmental variables (height, gradient, rainfall, etc.) that partially condition the presence or absence of a specific kind of forestation in an area. The aim of this work is to construct a set of feasibility models for woodland located in the basin of the River Liébana (NW Spain), to serve as a support tool for the experts entrusted with carrying out the reforestation project. The techniques used are multilayer perceptron neural networks and support vector machines. Their results will be compared to the results obtained by traditional techniques (such as discriminant analysis and logistic regression) by measuring the degree of fit between each model and the existing distribution of woodlands. The interpretation and problems of the feasibility models are commented on in the Discussion section. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - Understanding the effects of climatic change on mountain forests, where snowpacks and short growing seasons limit tree establishment and growth, is a key concern for both ecologists and foresters. We quantified associations between climatic and biophysical variables and individual conifer species distributions in mountain forests with generalized linear models. For the majority of species, a unimodal response to moisture and temperature gradients was evident, suggesting that an environmental niche can be identified. Species known to respond to limiting factors in the abiotic environment showed the strongest associations with predictor variables. The models can improve forecasts of the potential redistribution of species on the landscape in response to climatic change, but disturbance, migration rates, and limits on regeneration are important sources of uncertainty. Nevertheless, by identifying climate-based niches of different species, we can identify effective strategies for reforestation and alert managers to particularly sensitive or vulnerable ecosystems and landscapes.

AB  - A Decision Support System (DSS) was developed for the reservoirs operated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation that incorporates biological resources in a palette of decision variables. A scoring technique was developed for the DSS to help to evaluate the long-term effects of proposed reservoir system operations on those variables. The biological component of the DSS was developed to help Bureau of Reclamation reservoir operators evaluate the effects of different scenarios of reservoir operations on a variety of water-related biological resources. In this DSS, Reclamation's Reservoir Operations Modeling System (ROMS) is linked to modules evaluating power production, flood control benefits, irrigation water deliveries, municipal and industrial water supplies, habitat for endemic fish communities, tailwater fisheries, nesting habitat for shorebirds, reservoir recreation, reservoir fisheries, and regeneration of riparian cottonwood forests. Operation scenarios generated in ROMS are scored for each decision variable by comparison to a target range of a decision variable for a reference location and time period. The score for a variable is calculated based on the ratio between the percent of time that target conditions are met under alternative operating conditions and under the reference condition, respectively. A scoring technique was developed that recognizes that under either natural or highly managed conditions the reference target is not met at all times. Higher scores are achieved for environmental decision variables by operations scenarios that approach natural seasonal and annual variability in habitat availability. © 1999 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Two models for planning the cutting and planting of artificial forests in a district forest plan area are developed and demonstrated. Linear programming is used in both models. The first model is stochastic and is based on Suzuki's “Gentan Probability.” The objective of this model is to convert as near as possible the age class distribution of present forests to that of the generalized normal forest defined by Suzuki by the end of the tenth period by appropriately alloting an area of expansive reforestation to each period. The second model is designed to convert present forests to this normality in twenty periods (100 years) through controlling the removal of the growing stock with reforestation in each period to maximize the expected harvests during the conversion period. Both models proved to be useful in constructing a district forest plan. © 1981, THE JAPANESE FORESTRY SOCIETY. All rights reserved.
